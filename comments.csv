That intro felt like an apple event. Great job MKBHD team!
"Looks like your production quality is also increasing incrementally by 20% every year, it's awesome to see you and your team expressing your passion!"
Still one of my favorite tech channels!
The production quality has gone up and up and up and doesn't stop. Great work Marques and team!
"Sleek video editing quality, but also the review feels more grounded unlike those usual company-style reviews. Great vid, Marques and the team!"
I just love how much production went into you showing us the same gray box we've been getting for quite some time now.
Man these intros are super crazy! Kudos to the team for hours if not days of planning and execution to render out the finest of intros!!
"I purchased the M2 Pro without knowing it had just come out and I am blown away. I've had two MBPs prior to this, a 2010 MBP that lasted 7ish years (still runs) and a 2017 MBP that was plagued with issues (many many keyboard replacements) until the SSD died. I almost switched to a Linux build but Apple's OS and the tools I've come to appreciate are just too practical for daily non-nerd stuff. (shoutout Raycast for a beautiful spotlight alternative). Anyways, this addressed all the hardware shortcomings and complaints I had, and with it being second-generation silicon that has had time to mature the ecosystem is excellent. Couldn't recommend it enough, this thing rips."
I really want to say just how much I respect what you do and your approach man. You deserve all the success and more for raising the bar and showing just how good YouTube can be.
You and your team makes such great videos. Full of info while still be very entertaining. Thank you.
"The quality is so good that you wonder why other tech channels even try 😂 I've been watching for over 8 years so it's crazy to see the growth. Great review, I am hesitating between the M1 and M2 and this helped a lot."
"Man, the visual effects and videography are so freaking good. I love this channel."
Those intros are getting more and more fun each video. Like literally every intros and title screens are unique to the product it showcases. As if it was having fun and yet still feels professional. Kinda somewhat reminds me of the classic intros of you used to have.
"still can't get over how clean that intro was, probably the best they've had"
"Man of your word... Well done sir! I watched that review back then but didn't remember until now. From content to charisma to production quality, this tech channel is truly miles above the rest."
"Bro your videos are amazing, always informative yet entertaining and you’re the best speaker on YouTube 🙌 Also the production quality is incredible – really on par with Netflix and Hollywood productions! Your team is doing some God’s work, keep it coming"
Your videos only get better! So much quality. Thanks for the content. 😍
"Bro, you knock every video out of the ball park. Making tech specs fun to watch. Always happy for your success."
That robot intro ❤
"I really like how he pointed out to the people that ""should"" be waiting for the next M3 chips. You'll be waiting forever, but also miss out on some great deals on the older M1 that'll appear and you'll just waste your time and money by the time you're tired of waiting."
the opening shot looks amazing! you can tell they’re getting so much better at using that robot lol
"I've been waiting soooo eagerly for this machine. I'm on a 2015 15"" Macbook Pro, almost maxed out in spec. I have constantly maxed that machine out since new, but with the saga of the butterfly keyboards, removal of magsafe, etc etc... I had to wait so damn long for a replacement. Apple Silicon was an amazing swap, but I've also had to wait for the devs of the specific applications to support them. Now that is the case, I can look at finally get a workstation level machine in a laptop that can run Final Cut and astrophotography software."
"Man, congratulations on your superb production quality. You set the standard so high for the rest of tech YouTubers!"
"Would be interested to see the new Macbook Pro M2 Max stacked up against a current equivalent value windows laptop. The new apple silicon is so freaking good, would be interesting to see if intel/AMD laptops have made any gains."
"There's absolutely no one does this level of production on tech videos on YouTube, mad props!!🙌🏼"
"I still use the 16-inch, i9 8-core, 64gb ram from 3+ years ago and it's still an amazing powerhouse. The best laptop ive ever owned, love it so much. Looking forward to upgrading to these new M2, would like a bit more power at this point for multitasking while film editing, but not looking forward to dropping another $5k for it."
Mad respect for Marquees. I dont fail to watch your reviews before buying these products
"As for the M3, I know that Apple had a working Ray-tracing engine in their A-Series lineup planned and tested. But thermals in a phone form factor bombed it out. But what if that Ray-Tracing Engine were to be in the M3. Moving to a 3nm process node may give them the real estate to implement it in the laptop thermal envelope."
Love the honest and unbiased review from Marques!
"I love my M1 Macbook Air, but as I get further into my degree, the code I will be writing will give this thing some struggles. I do some football pxp analytics but filtering out 10 years of data takes over a minute. Some more power would definitely be ideal, and the Air not having many ports (I use a second monitor) is tough too. I have a bit of wire Jenga going on between my console, monitor, chargers, etc. An HDMI and more than 2 USB-C ports would go a long way for me in a new MBP."
"The production quality of this videos is the reason why I watch every single video from MKBHD, even the ones about stuff I don't care that much. It's amazing to watch the awesome work they all do with every single aspect of the video from start to finish."
"8:34 The new Mac mini interested me too. I won’t be getting one (I have the M1 Max Mac Studio and LOVE IT) but it’s interesting to see the M2 Pro in a Mac mini. That being said… they should’ve made the M2 Pro variety in Space Gray. That’s a way better look for the mini, and I’m disappointed the Mac Studio didn’t also get that darker color."
"I really want one of these, but I have no real need to upgrade my 13"" M1 (besides wanting a slightly larger screen).  A 14/16"" is very tempting though!"
"I just feel overwhelmed how much new tech comes out each year. Although I m not a macbook user, this year's macbook is getting me curious. Maybe by 2027, when the m5 will be here, I will finally switch from Dell! 😅"
"Really excited for the Mac Mini review! In my opinion it is affordable and powerful, and it is the product which will push the Apple Silicon series up the market."
"The most impressive part of his videos is him not saying “Umm” once. For as much information as he’s giving, he doesn’t use filler words. That in itself is impressive. He’s one heck of a speaker.

Edit: I typed this comment before he finished the video and said it like 35 seconds after. lol. Either way, still a dope, articulate, and engaging speaker."
The team at MKBHD is killing it again. The quality of the reviews keep going up and up.
MKBHD content just gets better and better I love it :)
Thank you for giving such a detailed review. I’m in the market for a laptop and this helps!
Imagine if there would be dynamic island for the upcoming MacBooks. Its gonna be soo good!!
"I had a 2012 MBP that cost me $2,900 fully spec’d out in 2012… I just upgraded to a $1,099 M2 Air… insane how much faster it is, and how far it’s come."
"Marques is excellent, and I have huge  respect for his reviews .Well presented, and he channel is definitely best on YouTube"
Man these intros feels from a different universe altogether. What production guys!
"He knows exactly what he’s talking about. He is so clear, and In my opinion the best tech reviewer out there! Keep up the amazing work 🎉"
I loved the real world example shown of screenflow. that's the stuff that actually matters
"I have a M1 MBP from $work and I’ve called it “beta hardware”. It takes a while to get packer to build an x86 image (because servers are still x86 - this was improving, but beta hardware would). I’ve also run into path issues with things like terraformer etc. The chip is solid, but it’ll take another year or so for it not to get in my way."
"Great video as always, love your work. I have to say I have always been a PC person, I mainly was into gaming in my spare time as I grew up. My brother was the sports ball guy, I was the tech gaming enthusiast. We had MACs growing up and PCs, I always gravitated towards the PCs. My new job had the option to go PC or Macbook. I do a lot of data processing and the PC was what I thought I would need to help flow better. there are still things I can do on a PC with MS suite better. I do have to say though, I have really come around to the Macbook. I have an older intel chip one, I believe a 2020. I really love the built in fingerprint scanner, I've really liked the touch bar for quick access on some stuff. I do dual boot windows with bootcamp if I need a windows application that isnt on Mac like Access. My only complaints about this system are 1 post ventura update, my mac will randomly shut down during sleep due to an error. 2 doing multiple monitors on this macbook was hell and I had to buy expensive special hardware for it (I need multi screens on my working set up) and I can only have two additional monitors even with the special hardware I have. 
     The new upgrade sounds nice, but I am pretty sure you cannot dual boot windows on it. Also I would miss the touch bar, I dont use it all the time but man when I do I love it and kind of want one on my next PC laptop."
"Great info, great video and great delivery! You are very nice to follow during your explanations. Tech with some fun! Greetings from Europe!"
It's an honor to have grown up together following tech and watching your videos. They just keep getting better and better
Many thanks for making this video! Been reading and watching video reviews on the new Mac. I'm one of the ones who has an older mac (2012 here lol) but watching your video and Andres Vidoza's review have helped tremendously on my decision
"Im still rocking my M1 16GB MBA, so I won't upgrade anytime soon, but man this M2 MBP is a monster!
Nice work as always Marques!"
"Hey Bro, love yer work. Any thoughts on how hot that big boy M2Max is getting on the heftier workloads. I’ve held out for so long to upgrade my MBP and feeling like the time is right with these new configs. I just don’t want to experience the same heat problems I’ve had with my 2011 model (lap blisters, screen melting etc)."
"snagged the base model M1 Macbook pro on sale for $1500 and while I feel like that was a killer deal, the tech consumer in me wants the newest and best thing lol. But I'm sure the base M1 pro will still cruise through music production and other basic needs."
Be great to hear your thoughts on apple taking away the M1 pro / max laptops and now have their baseline pro laptop i.e the m2 pro £200 more expensive. Feels like a bit of a money grab. The M1 Pro is more than enough power for most pro apps not that I’m against an upgrade of power. Just a shame  they’re essentially raising the price of a pro model by £200 for something no one was asking for. Will the m5 be £1k more expensive?
"That intro was smooth af, those transitions were absolutely beautiful"
Looks Amazing! you can tell they’re getting so much better❤️
3:30 2 questions... a) where are the more recent cpus from Intel on the cinebench charts as comparison? I did not see 12 or 13th gen represented. b) I know thermal throttling can make a difference in overall performance. Any idea how the cooling solution on these laptops are doing in keeping the cpu working full speed for more than a minute?
I can't wait for the episode where MKB reviews his knew maxed out Mac Pro.  I feel like Apple has already developed the machine and is just scrambling to get the matte black finish on the box perfect.
"Great review(as usual)...I have the first gen 16"" and I could use a bump ...considering it.."
Always enjoy watching your review videos. Some of the most solid informal content on YouTube. Intro was sick btw. Really impressive.
"Just a comment on the chart topping single core cinebench score. Saw 1700 for m2 max, but I recall getting around 1600 on my 5800x. I think the 13th gen Intel and 7000 series and chips hit over 2000. M2 max looking great nonetheless :)"
"I have a MB Pro from 2012, LOL. I was going to buy an M2 MB Pro, but based on what you're saying, sounds like an M1 will provide a huge performance upgrade without breaking the bank. Thanks for the tip."
"I'm over here rocking an M1 MacBook Air, and desperately looking for a reason to upgrade. But...I can't! Literally, this has been the best laptop I've ever owned. I'll probably have it another three years and it'll run dependably because Apple did SUCH a knockout job. They really hit the ground running!"
I personally really like the touchbar. I have the M1 macbook pro and its always so much fun using the touchbar and I never understood why it got so much hate
"Indeed, if you're going to wait for new tech, you will be waiting forever... Of course, everything depends on your situation. If you can afford to wait a couple of weeks/months. It might be worth it. But like you said: Technology improves constantly. That Mac Mini looks really interesting! 😎"
"It's crazy, Marques' videos are the only videos I watch full without skipping a bit. And when a video is out, I cannot wait to sit down and watch it ! Props to your hard work Marques! 🙏"
"I am just so excited for new tech, it's one of the few things that create hope for a better future"
"I decided to stop waiting for a M2 Pro when I wanted to upgrade from my 13 M1 MBP in November when all things combined (welcome offer on a new credit card, cash back on that card, it being on sale, being able to sell my original M1) it came out to just under 2 grand before selling my M1 MBP. Loved it since and since I'm not in the category that needs a super uber powerful laptop not looking to upgrade (I would have gone with the Air if they had a 15 inch with ProMotion because I'm sensitive to refresh rate)"
"Might finally upgrade my maxed out 15” from 2015! 
But I think I’ll go down to the 14” , I don’t like the overly large track pad"
Question: What about Apple’s M2 Max chip with 30-core GPU vs Apple’s M2 Max chip with 38-core GPU 🤔 That’s my buying dilemma ordering the MacBook Pro 14-inch with Apple’s new M2 Max chip …curious about thoughts which new M2 Max chip to choose ?
"Crazy Good Footage. Your review is definitely at another level. It is truely sophisticated, well organized, and super interesting. Getting insight through watching your vids. Thanks!"
"That was a sick intro. This is literally why I watch these, for the sheer production quality."
Man the intros never disappoint 🙌
It would be great to start including the Blender benchmark when comparing benchmark results
"I can confirm that they where planed way earlier. The Devices where showing up in Partner Buy Portals around October or even September but had no prices. Usally they show up around 4 weeks before launch according to my Suppliers. 

Maybe they had issues producing enough units to start selling them"
Great review. I really wish their baseline for storage at this point was 1tb. I really don't want to spend an additional $200 to upgrade from 512gb to 1tb.
"Love your team's video creation skill!  As an avid Final Cut Pro user the M2 Pro 16"" has been CLUTCH, I am coming from a 2013 iMac 27"".  I must ask (to anyone on this channel) how do I get my iPhone 13 Pro footage shot in 4K to look more ""cinematic"" and not like news footage?  I know how to color balance and all of that, but much of my footage looks like Family Ties and not Back to the Future (hopefully most get that reference).  Any help would be appreciated."
You know a video is so good that people are commenting about the quality of the video instead of the product the video is about. Kudos to the whole team. Nailing it every single time.
"Your production quality is on point and also, I love your understated humour.... Like with this video, you said wait until Q3 of 2027 to prove a point that waiting for the best thing in tech basically means you're going to be waiting forever!"
"5:06 I actually didn’t know the new MacBook Pros had mini-LED. Before I bought my M2 iPad Pro (12.9”) I would’ve been interested in that… but the mini-LEDs of this iPad’s screen are the worst part of the device.

I upgraded my TV last year from a typical LED to an LG NanoCell and hated it because of the local dimming zones. I exchanged it for an OLED, and obviously that’s superior. But honestly, if OLED didn’t exist… I’d have a typical LED TV. As much as the fully backlit panel isn’t great for contrast, at least it was consistent. The blocks of lit pixels around lit areas in contrast to the true black areas away from those light areas makes the device honestly look defective.

Knowing that mini-LED has the same issue as those NanoCell TVs (albeit slightly improved) kills my interest… this iPad has vignetting all the time and at night the local dimming of the mini-LEDs is hideous. It’d make me miss my A12X iPad Pro from 2018 if the rest of the M2 one wasn’t so great."
"Well I’m a new subscriber and love your presentation of what users want. I’m not video editing (yet) but since I’m old enough to have been exposed to magnetic punch tape programming and other ancient slow things I’m all about spending the money for long term service. You’ve convinced me to invest in an m2 max 16” MacBook with at least 64gb ram and maybe the 96gb I need space so I’ll go with 4TB ssd. I was thinking only a Mac mini but I want the ability to be portable 
Nothing more frustrating when you want to carry your computer with you and you can’t because you chose to save a few thousand. It’s only a 1 time purchase so it’s important to spend right."
"Loved the intro, the transition was so smooth. Amazing work!"
"I love the way you explain this. Jumps and bumps. Also, the production quality you have is insane. Love it."
Editing is 🔥i like how the apple lights up. I like the purple. Nice review very technical comparing the 2 processors
Funny how the first thing I’ve been looking forward to after seeing the M2 Macbook pros was this video! Says a lot about how MKBHD is a cultural reference.
The display on this thing is sick. I love  mine. Mac is a really good laptop.
Literally went for my phone to shout out the intro.  Mkbhd’s intros are master classes in themselves.  Props sir!
"nice content, i like the way you breaking it down to the viewers understanding"
Amazing production and nice review. Hearing these come out honestly just makes me hope to find a good M1 MacBook deal! Was literally looking for laptops as this video dropped
"I've needed a new computer since my mid 2014 Macbook Pro, and this might be one of the greatest upgrade with the tech differences. Still chugging along on an i7 4 core CPU with 16GB RAM. Last Mac before my current one had its GPU throttled I needed a replacement card after 3 years (cause I burned it out after some hefty After Effects renders lmao). With my current Mac being about 9 years old, I predict that I could probably get two decades out of an M2 Chip if it didn't lose compatibility with new OSes first."
I’ve been on a 2015 iMac trying to edit 4k footage and 360 footage and I wait on my rainbow wheel after almost every click lol takes all the fun out of editing. This seems like the perfect laptop for me. Can I buy the one you used for the video?
"the level of editing is insane, deserves more like"
"Another great reviews as always, great job God bless 🙏🏾"
"Hey Marques! Could you, please, make a video on how to protect the screen of the MacBook Pros (especially the newer ones) from getting the keys from the keyboard permanently imprinted (scratching) on the display? Especially if you put a laptop on top of another laptop."
"the film proccess behind your videos is amazing. Im just getting started in videography and photography, and seeing how clean the scenes flow from one to the next, and seemingly flawless transtions are truly something I aspire to be able to do in my own way. thats for being an Insportation :)"
After several reviews finally one that addressed the difference between the pro and max
"Always the best reviewer, thank you!"
"Great points, I'm sticking with my M1 16.
BTW, I love when you and Max Tech fight"
I been watching this brother for a long time. He’s information is on point. Thanks bro.
"You're right when you say it's not a 'quantum leap', because that would technically be the smallest possible iteration they could make, but a respectable speed bump seems spot on.  As for the socks and sandals, awesome!!"
That intro was awesome ! job well done Marques !
"This video overall was so good, beginning, ending, everything was so perfect it feel’s impossible. This is why i watch this guy, motivates the hell out of me to start yt."
"You're the only YouTuber I know who can pull off that look, MKB. Thanks for staying true to your word and props for wearing shower sandals to the studio."
"Hey Marques, thanks for the review, but one thing I haven’t been able to understand yet is: how does the M2 Max compare to the M1 Ultra? Can you include that in a future video?"
"In the UK they have gone from £1.8k to £2.1k for the base model 14"", although some of this is to do with the drop in value of the pound I would imagine?"
"Thanks for the video! Love it. I always come and watch your stuff if I'm looking for reviews 👍. Could you please compare the M2 Macbook Air vs new Macbook Pro? There is such a small price difference, is it worth the extra money?"
"Hey! Everyone,
I have a question regarding the Geekbench score that like the Apple optimizes these laptops for applications like final cut pro or others. Can`t they also optimise the Geekbench application and improve the score of these new laptops thus misleading ?
p.s. thanks for the amazing video Marques"
"The craziest part is that we haven't seen full software optimization of the new silicon yet.  Once the software catches up, we are going to see even more dramatic improvements in performance and power consumption."
"How does this dude get 3 million views within two days? This dude is the best tech reviewer on YouTube. I wish we would review TVs more often though. 

As far as the new MacBook goes, it looks dope; but I wish they didn't get rid of the Touch Bar. I have 2020 16 inch MacBook Pro and I love the Touch Bar. Also, adding the notch on top was unnecessary."
Really like the intro.  I also really enjoy the new macbook pro with the m2 max
"I think we are at the point where you guys are making better Apple commercials than Apple could, that intro was great"
"My biggest surprise when recently moving from PC (hated windows 11 layout) to a MAC was that I thought many of the iOS and iPadOS apps that I use would be available for my MBA, but to my surprise a lot are missing and I have to settle for safari bookmarks. Anyone knows why? And how I create home icons of a website?"
Random Question: How much ram & storgae would you recommend for 10 bit video and photo editing? Also m1 pro or max?
i can’t stop watching this intro over and over. it’s so smooth. i love it
"I see that I can get the old M1 Max for the same price as the new M2 Pro. More GPU, transistors and bandwidth memory with the M1 Max vs more CPU with the M2 Pro. Which of these two configurations do you think is the best pick? I will probably be satisfied with either one of them. I mainly work in PS,LR and FCPX."
"I'm so curious if M2 Max are capable of 3D animation and rendering it into a video. I have an underpowered Macbook Air from 2017 and I just use it for basic everyday tasks because it can't handle 3D animation, I have a more powerful Windows computer for 3D work. But I always loved the battery life of the Apple laptop, and how portable it is. If M2 Max can do 3D animation or 3D modeling, that would be amazing."
man the quality of your work goes up a notch year over year respect is off the charts for you and the team you've built keep up the good work
"After watching that short on the making of the intro, I have a new found appreciation for this intro. So dope 🔥"
I really wonder if the M2’s missing the 2 video encoders makes a difference
"Great video, love the intricated zoom in for looking for clues when it was done!!!"
The cinematography in the intro sequence is just perfect.
"You kill it with the only product reviews that I actually believe. Thanks, Marques."
I watched the M2 MacBook Air behind the scenes video on the studio channel recently and it’s given me a huge appreciation for the effort that goes into the intros. Awesome video Marques and team! ❤
I have the M2 MacBook Air and it works flawless don’t see myself upgrading it any time soon. Btw the ending was funny
Great explanation of upgrades.
"You should make an annual video where following new Apple product launches you talk about which device in the current line-up of Macs/Macbooks, iPads, iPhones and Watches is the right one to buy for each different type of consumers based on their needs and which device they currently have, so basically a consumer guide! That would be super interesting!"
"I wonder though, does the M2 Pro allow you to connect 3 external monitors? I sometimes do that on my work Intel Mac Pro, but have been told by colleagues on M1 Mac Pros that they won't work with 3 external screens (in fact somebody was looking for a work around for it just yesterday). If the M2 does allow 3 external screens (not necessarily high res ones, just not artificially limiting the number of monitors regardless of resolution), might have to talk to IT about making M2s available for those who've hit the laptop upgrade cycle time!"
"I’m about to get the 14inch m2 max with 32 gb memory but I’m wondering if I should up the memory to 64gb. Is the extra $400 necessary? I do graphic design work, using Adobe Creative Suite programs like InDesign, Photoshop and AI, tons of vector work. Plus, doing animations and video editing work using After Effects and Premiere Pro. Thanks"
"I've had the M1 macbook pros for half a year now and I am still so grateful that my company bought 1 for me. There are times I was able to squeeze up to 2 days of work on it. And it is an absolute beast. Going from a 4 year old i5 to M1 pro was such a huge leap. But I agree, it is way too unnecessary for personal use. Though I can imagine well-endowed people buying it just for the 16 inch screen size."
"Marques, you’re good for so many reasons, including keeping your word. Great content as always"
What’s your thoughts about the price? Apple says that the price stays the same in US but here in Sweden the price has bumped from 2200$ to 2900$!
That new intro is CLEAN AF ❤
What do you do with previous models of everything since you'll obviously start using the new ones?
"Do you see much of a benefit of upgrading to the 1TB M2 Pro option? I dont think I will need the Max, personally. Just wondering if the extra few cores make that much of a difference (I am a software dev, currently have 512GB 2018 model and dont have storage issues)."
I am highly impressed with the production quality of Marques. The 14 years of dedication and hard work is truly admirable
Really nicely done review. No flush just relevant info. Thx
I can't wait for the M8. Its gonna be great!
Dude! Your transitions area an art!!!
"Hey Marques, awesome video. Did apple send you also 14” M2 Pro? I know it will be mostly the same difference as 16” M2 Max vs 16” M1 Max, but I would like to see side by side comparison of base 14” M1 Pro and 14” M2 Pro. I remember 14” having some problems with thermos compare to 16” so I am wondering if they fixed that."
"I haven't watched the video and probably never will cuz I don't give a flying f*** about MacBooks, but that intro, man, was just something else. I literally get goosebumps seeing it. And I have lost count of how many times I've rewinded to watch it again and again. Very professional, just incredible."
"Hands down the only place we should be looking for all areas of the Tech world!!  Thanks Marques pure talent, and great info. 👍🏾🙏🏾"
Ultra-High-Quality Content as always.
the audio quality sounds so good loving those new mics👌
I actually loved the touch-bar
"I am using M1 pro on 16 inch MacBook and the biggest thing which i love about the device is  the battery life, it  is just amazing ."
"What gave away that the ""event"" video was filmed months ago was the weather. I live a couple of miles away from Apple Park and it's been raining a lot. The skies in the video are fairly good, so probably wasn't filmed in the past month at least."
"I literally watched the intro 5 time. Hats off to Marquez and the team, the production quality is on a whole another level"
"OMG, quality and intro. SEEEEK” Love this robots with cameras, so much possibilities and creativity expression can be made. Well, one thing nobody mention is: Entrance was as much seek and great just as ending is ;))"
"I guess I'm one of the few that's been generally ""eh"" about my Macbook Pro (M2 Pro). My usual workstation is a 12th i7, 3060ti. Running them side-by-side, they are basically at the same level (the desktop eeks by roughly 20% faster, but only really noticeable in 2hr-long exports). The prices were roughly the same too when I _bought_ the desktop, but now you can get it for $1000 less than when I did, meaning $1500 less than an M2 Pro. That's an insane brand fee, but similarly insane how easily the hype is able to carry such a large price gap."
This is Marvel level production quality! Cheers my friend
I LOVE THE EDITING. Great job!!!
"Considering getting an M2. Kind of bummed it doesn't have the touch bar, as It was such a cool feature on some of my friends older MacBook pros. Are the touch bars really that bad though?"
"Love the vid. The most disappointing thing to me is just not having Face ID, it would be an easy competitor for Windows Hello since that's usually super quick (for me at least). Different platforms and whatnot, but just a missed opportunity, unless they're planning to adapt some island type of notch like on the 14 pro series, it doesn't sound super useful, but might be a possibility"
"Great real world review, and someone not saying that ""the old one was slow so you must upgrade"". Thx"
"All Apple Silicon Macs so far are interesting in some way... but I'm still waiting for the Mac Pro (not necessarily to buy it though).

TBF, socks and sandals look ok and are very comfortable."
This intro though. Amazing 😍
I LOVE my M1 Pro 14” and don’t see myself upgrading for a long time
What non-apple monitor would work well with the M2 mac mini pro? I am a graphic and UI/UX designer. Colour calibrated is very important.
Man the intros never disappoint 🙌🏻
"Thanks Marques for this video and beautiful presentation in it.  Is there any other competitive brands matching to this  model, atleast close to it?"
Simply the best channel for tech!
Great eye for the 2022 url! It's a small thing but it makes me appreciate your meticulousness in tech stuff more.
Intro was sick! Great job. I love it.
I have the mid 2012 MacBook Pro and was looking to upgrade to a newer machine  - Think i'm just going to upgrade the components inside of my machine after seeing loads of reviews
These intros are just top notch!!! Kudos to the MKBHD Production Team
"I don't use Apple product, but honestly, even with that incremental improvement, if I want a Macbook that HDMI 2.1 alone is a good enough feature to have over last year (8k maybe silly, but 4k 120hz totally isn't)"
"I want to see proof you wore socks and sandals for 24 hrs (rather than 5 seconds) :) Good work as always MB team. Was looking for your ""preview"" of the M2 mac mini last week , but am still interested in seeing your review when it comes out (although my first apple computer is already ordered)."
Marques you deserve the views and likes everyone pours on your content! Gratitude brother! Ordering my M2 Max soon! Upgrading from the 2019 Intel CPU MBP is going to be wild! 😎
unbeatable great review mkb!
Apple is killing it with these laptops.. i'm definitely going to get one of those
Thanks for the consistent quality of tech reviews year in & year out.👏🏾
"Love your videos man, waiting for Q3 2027 really made me laugh - been saying that to people for years! 😀"
"Socks and sandals all day hahaha, nice!
Also really cool review, as someone with an XPS 15 9570, the M-series MacBooks are getting more and more interesting"
That intro was insane!🔥
No one does tech reviews as good as MKBHD
"Awesome!! Thanks for the information, I was looking at these for a while"
"Over time, I think I’m more curious about the intro of your videos than the review itself! Quality production, quality video and quality content."
I have a 2012 MacBook Pro and I’m looking to get a new one since this one is extremely slow. I thought it was the storage but it’s not. I have a lot of storage space left. So I guess getting the M2 is worth it.
"Very good analysis, thank you."
How the hell do they manage these insane single core results?
Impressed by the technically impressive opening shot; RESPECT FOR THE ENDING HAHAHAHAHA
Any idea what it cost to build a M2 chip?
That intro was Apple Keynote level of quality!!! 🤯
I got an M1 Pro 14” on sale from Costco for massive savings and only bottleneck I ran into was trying to use an hdmi 2.1 tv with 444 color at even just 60hz. Oh well DisplayPort 1.4 should handle it fine. The M1 Pro is a beast even still and I definitely recommend getting it on sale!
"I am kind of mad they didnt release the black colour they have on the airs for this mac, that one is so beautiful"
That intro segement looked and felt amazing! Any chance of doing a video about how your intro segements evolved among the years?
"I just picked up the  apple M1 max 16"" w/32 gig ( my very first apple product) 
Salesman told me it had 2.1 hdmi support. Well we know that was wrong. Is it worth it to just upgrade to the M2 max and bite the bullet for my very first?"
"I have an M1 macbook air from 2021, and this thing surprises me every day with the amount of power it has. I always have at least 20 tabs open, plus other demanding tasks, like blender with lots of parts and a 3d printer slicer, as well as some other things, and this thing doesn't even slow down for a second."
that’s one one of the sickest intros i’ve ever seen! quality of y’all’s videos are still so good
"Super is the way how you making these videos without stress and with fun, with informative and useful suggestion."
"Insane introduction - came for the intro, stayed for the review"
This intro is just so perfect I can't 😭
"Damn, what an intro 🔥🔥🔥"
"I got an 16” M1 Max 32GB off eBay about a week ago. It was a pretty good deal too. I’ll hang on to this one for a while. Coming from the 13” M1, the huge trackpad is messing with me. I find myself accidentally activating shortcuts because my palm rests on it. I do really miss my Touch Bar though."
The amount of these that will end up just being used for Word or web will be astounding.
"I started watching you wayback 2014 before buying my Samsung Galaxy Note 4. Now, I’m still watching you using my very first ios device, Apple 14 Pro Max. Time flies! 🥹"
"Stayed until the end and wasn’t disappointed 🧦🩴🤣
You’re a man of your word, indeed!"
I loved the real world example shown of screenflow. that's the stuff that actually matters
Amazing production and nice review. Hearing these come out honestly just makes me hope to find a good M1 MacBook deal! Was literally looking for laptops as this video dropped
Those intros are getting more and more fun each video. Like literally every intros and title screens are unique to the product it showcases. As if it was having fun and yet still feels professional. Kinda somewhat reminds me of the classic intros of you used to have.
Solid review.  Keep it up kid !
Great video as always =)
I love your review style and uplifting tone. Cool review.
That intro was a MAJOR flex! So sick!
"At this point, it's all about those refurb deals, IMO. It's the first time in a long time (maybe ever) that I was excited for a new MBP release, just so I can send discounted M1 Pro/Max refurb links to my friends who are in the market. Thanks for all the work and effort you and your team put into these vids, Marques 🍻"
"I have the last version of the intel MacBook pro, it serves me well. I am in no hurry to upgrade for now. I figure I have about one more year with my intel MacBook until I’ll have to upgrade."
"I'm a motion designer and I'm planning to buy that one, but my question is do I need a 96 GB Ram?"
Great review thanks looking to pick up a really well priced M1 Max or entry entry level M2 Max for programming. I am getting sick of Windows 11 and the incredibly poor battery life of PC laptops. The only issue is I use Ubuntu a lot but think that Mac OSX and virtualization on the Mac will be sufficient.
Curious about the return to the mag safe charger. I had a Circa 2017 MacBook Pro and needed to replace it in 2020 because the batteries were overheating and starting to bloat. Is the mag safe charger safer now?
That opening alone was one of the best things I’ve ever seen on this site
you're now probably the only tech guy I follow and this video shows why yet again. Super nice quality man! Can't wait for the Mac mini review 💸
He delivered on the socks and sandals bit. MKBHD is undefeated
That intro was so clean that I don't even need a shower anymore. THANKS MKBHD!
That's some fire intro . Love it 🔥🔥
"As always helpful, thanks!"
"Wow, that intro was beautiful!"
Network and cable tv tech reviews can't compete with what you bring to the YouTube community. As always top tier review👍🏾
"I'm waiting a few years before plopping down 5k. Can you believe that my 2011 Macbook Pro is still going strong with the 1GB Nvidia Graphics Card. I can't do more than 1080P. lol

Love the review!"
That production level is over 9000!
What’s better? 30GPU OR 38GPU on a MacBook M2 Max? Is it worth going for the extra 8?
"The socks and the sandals though😂
Marques, the man of his words!"
"Marques, you and your production team should make a movie already!"
Amen on your point about waiting for upgrades 👏 So easy to get caught up in the waiting game. Good tech is here now!
Litterally rewatched the intro more than 100th time now🙌
"You know, I feel like this video was ONLY made for the ending. Look, I understand the reality of it all, come on, but with the incremental improvements it has did it really deserve a full video? No it didn't. 
 
The fact that he stayed true to his word on socks and sandals 🤣🤣🤣was deserving of a video. 

GGs MK and thank you Studio team for ANOTHER banger. 

Side note, I LOVE THE NEW INTRO to the videos. Chef's Kiss"
"I use M1 pro, it's really awesome 😎"
"I have an entry level 1st gen 15inch touchbar mbp (late 2016), how big of a jump will i expect when i upgrade to m2 max?😂"
"Wow, they brought back all the features I wanted"
"We're all gonna comment about it, but the pure fire in that opening and the level of work is incredible. Love following this channel and seeing it grow. From the college days and Cheerios boxes to robots and Teslas 👏👏"
These intros are starting to be NEXT LEVEL!! WOW
That intro was fire 🔥
Hopefully in the future there's a full review of MacBook pro M1 ULTRA VS M2 ULTRA
I think I will have to upgrade my tech to keep up with the quality of MKBHD’s videos. 😂
I’m trying to get like you my boy you literally test any product you want😂🔥🔥
"I really like the honesty of: You don't really need to wait. If you need/want to upgrade, just get something when it's cheap and on sale in the next 6 months"
The quality and editing of this video is immaculate
Thought about getting this for my brother but the soldered SSDs are a big no.
That intro is 🔥🔥🔥
"Well another obvious indicator that they were ready last year is the delivery time fro order, it's usually weeks or even months"
"The new M3s coming September, probably 🔥🔥🔥"
Definitely interested to see battery life of the M2 generation compared to M1 generation in real world tests. Specifically M2 Pro 14in. Tempted to step up to the MBP 14in. Just not sure if I need/want to give up battery life compared to the M1 in my MBP 13in. It is astonishingly good.
The ending was epic 🤣
The QUALITY though!!! Best production on YouTube
Really cool intro as always.
"problem for me, is that I know at some point, the notch will go - guaranteed! So I just can't bring myself to purchase the new M2 machine (despite starting to need an upgrade from the 2019 i7 MBP). So I'm not waiting for the chip, more so for a refinement in the design. Just because I dislike the notch and when they do redesign (probably end of this year or next year), I'll regret not holding off."
what would be a good sale price for an M1?
That intro was smooth! They keep getting better with each video.
Can definitely see why they didn’t need an event just to update a couple of Macs from M1 to M2.. people would have just complained that it was an underwhelming event!
That ending❤
"I love you Marques, great analysis really Pro-sumer youtuber ❤"
Petition for a compilation of all your intros filmed with the robot.. could watch for days 🥰
The number of menu bar options he has 😂 6:18
Still one of my favorite tech channels! Thank you Marques!
went from m1 air to m2 pro.... already so much better!!!
What is the ssd capacity of that configuration?
Yeah. I have an M1 Pro 16. I’ll wait for the next gen in 2024/2025.  Especially considering the new Pro is super loud vs the 2021.
This was so pro! New sub with great appreciation 😊
"Hi mkbhd. So, my wonder now is if M1 Max or M2 Pro would be faster, and or cheaper to get"
Love this production quality and honest review!
"You’re my idol dude, I’ve been following you for a long time and you’re the absolute best out there"
The intro is so amazing its give goosebumps.
ye bnda intro’s next level bnata hai. Mad respect to MKBHD
"Top tier intro, my mouth dropped. Thanks for the great info"
Apple should just hire you guys to do their commercials that intro was sick
"I'd love it if you could dive deeper into the 8K scaling options under ""Show all resolutions"". For instance, can you use it as a Retina quality 4K equivalent? What about HiDPI settings above 4K, like 6K equivalent, for example. Thanks!"
I'm not an Apple fan but those M-chips are pretty legit.  Currently have an m1 MBP because of work and the battery life is awesome. Thinking of getting an Air because of that reason alone.
"I'm one of these ""naah I've made a mistake"".. 11 months in on a 16"" M1 Pro and the battery only lasts for 6 hours at best, down to 93% after just 83 cycles, the display is noticeably dimmer than 2019 16"" MBP and is hard to see outdoors, I've been using 6-7 different macbooks in the past 10 years and it's the first time I actually notice a bloom around the mouse cursor on dark backgrounds (so much for the microleds...) and the buggy Ventura doesn't make the situation any better in the last few months... Is it fast - yes, definitely very fast but still not faster than my 5950X hack at compiling Xcode projects or in Final Cut Pro..."
Amazing editing in the intro.
"Marques, I want to hear more about Apple not releasing the Mini and Pro 2 last year when they should have."
"When he said he spent over $250K on the camera robot, I thought that was insane, but having watched the intro, it's worth every penny!"
Your videos are just so much fun to watch. I watch them for the vibe as much as the tech.
"I purchased my first MacBook last year (m1 14in with 32gb ram). Best laptop I've ever had - using it for music production (cubase 12).

How long do Macbooks generally last?"
"I know the GPU performance on these machines is amazing, but if you don't edit videos and they are not good for gaming, what use people will have for all that power  ?"
My 16” M2 Max MBP arrives today! Can’t wait!
That is the sickest opening scene to a tech vid I have ever seen
Have watched every macbook review from mkbhd but never owned one xD
"Hey team, loved your content for years now! 

Just letting you know when you're watching on the TV App, the automatic Shop link populates over the beautiful intro shot, and doesn't go away unless you manually press back on your remote, so you have to rewind every time.
I know you put a lot of effort into your intros, so just something to think about.

Great video as usual!"
"Here for the socks and sandles.

As a matter of principle; I’m still waiting for a large screen iMac, before upgrading my MBP…
And my MBP is a 15 from 2015- so; it’s kind of dire.

That said- the new form factor+Apple Silicon is everything I ever wanted from a new MBP. Maybe I should give in."
The robot shots are getting better every video
"When your production budget is in the tens, if not, hundreds of thousands of dollars the least it can do is look this good."
"Wow, i wish i can buy something like this to pursue my music career o_o, prolly feels good to be like you"
"editing skills are amazing, great info.. was looking at the darker macbooks today... i really want one, but what about all my steam games from windows......"
"rocking the m1 air. The best laptop i`ve ever had; not looking forward to replacing it anytime soon, but when I do, the performance of the machines on the market at that time will be humongous"
I’ve rewatched that intro about 16 times now. No word of a lie
Are the fans as quiet as the M1 pros? I never hear my fans spin up and I’ve never felt the chassis get hot. Is this still the case?
That intro felt like an apple event
Is the HDMI port still so bloody wobbly as on previous model?
"The thing that still blows my mind about these laptops is the performance while running on battery power. Windows laptops simply can’t compare in that regard. Additionally, the battery life is outstanding. My laptop will last for several days where windows laptops will die after only a few hours of normal use."
"From reviews in general, seems they keep optimising for video editing but 3D performance is still not up there and Blender is a frequent part of my workflow. So for now, I'll have to look forward to the next ones."
"I’d have an M1 Pro 16” MacBook Pro already if it still had a Touch Bar.

I don’t think the Touch Bar was an issue, but rather a huge feature that third parties neglected. The new MacBook Pros needed to have a physical function row AND a Touch Bar, which solves both issues."
Awesome review as always but ain’t nothing wrong with socks and sandals (during winter in SoCal lol)
Brought back the incredible intros 😢
this video makes me wanna go in debt now and buy that robotic arm thing...absolutely amazing intro
"16 inch M1 is still my go. It's not worth the $2,600 upgrade for the M2. I agree it's not for people who already have the The M1 lab-top. Good point."
I honestly believe this is some of the best production quality I have ever seen on YouTube. Absolutely awesome!
"Great review, like always. Next time a little more stressful than socks & sandals please, maybe, walk in the park with it :)."
"Thanks for showing us how fast video editing is ... I was frankly embarised when i sold someone that email all day and realy wanted a mac with outlook /  that uses roseria / You did not touch on that at all but thanks for you video about how it makes your life great thats what apple seams to have concentrated on making a machine for SMI so you can tell us all how good it is / Don't fell bad i like you vids and leave the shoes for linus who was no better.... after i delivered what everyone said was great i looked and  Microsoft: Office will be about 20 seconds slower initially on Apple Silicon, Rosetta 2... is it any better now on a mail client with at least 5 gigs of emails... Agree with what you say about the screens it's just a new name for old technology..."
I thought they announced the M2 minis at the same time as the MacBook Pros.
Bro you just keep stepping your game up!
Nobody sent me the memo about socks and sandals. When they both got better I naturally put them together. I thought it was just dress socks and shorts. Hmmm. My first mac was a mini along with the 20 gb FireWire iPod 2nd. Massively better than my outgoing Atari st  and IBM PC one with the dedicated graphic interface chip. So naturally I had to get the fire sale Microsoft Duo to update the iPod experience. So many taboo combos
that consistency of staying true to his word and wearing socks and sandals like Linus is priceless😭
"Love the video, but those CPU stats were kinda misleading. New laptop (H) 13th gen i9s are averaging scores around 1950 and the desktop version K varient is way out in front with 2300."
Just curious to know what's your internet speed in the studio 😁
"Bro the sheer quality of the video production... 

Like dayuuuum!!!"
"With Macbooks already destroying the competition before M2, these changes just widen the gap even more"
"This is great and all, but what happens if something needs to be replaced? Do I need to pay half of what I already paid to get it fixed? Or can I get inside to replace something obvious like the battery or SSD?"
"Keep up the good work Marques, love the reviews, the M2 max looks amazing! 😁👍"
Lol I waited for an year for the first apple silicon mac to come out so that it doesn’t get outdated quick andddddd now I’m using an M1 macbook pro with the touch bar feeling old seeing all these new hardware
That intro was soo sick🔥🔥🔥
"Honestly, I got the 14"" M1 Pro last year. For my needs, it's already completely OP and I can't imagine needing more performance. 20% more would be completely wasted on me."
"Isn't the darker silver called grey?
nice video btw 🙂"
Is it worth the upgrade from M1 Pro to m2 pro? or is that overkill?
the opening shot looks amazing! you can tell they’re getting so much better at using that robot lol
Oh my god! The intro is legendary 😯💯👏🏽👍🏽
I am so surprised that the macbook pro doesnt have face recognition but my razer blade does.
Bro that intro was perfect ! It feels like 1000 fps 🤝😂 LOL
Is it worth upgrading from Mac Pro M1 Max to Mac prob m2 max?
"Great review Marques, like you haven't heard enough of such comments already😄"
"Holy crap! Your intro was the quality of an actually apple presentation!! Keep up the fantastic work, I’d love to see more of that cinematography and motion graphics worked into the rest of the video. Like walking with a tracking shot for example rather than just sitting down and talking to a camera."
that was such a clean intro God damn
"What a great ending, cheers man :D"
M2 Max MacBook Pro realy very nice work i love its.
This guy is so good.  Best I've heard
Brilliant review.
"Out of all the reviews I always seem to go for MKBHD's first, because I know the intro and transitions are going to be the best.
Great review, as always, seems to be incremental updates for things I don't need/use (don't need 8K60 for a while nor Wi-Fi 6E either). As such, extremely happy with my M1 Pro MBP, no plans to upgrade for a couple of years yet (at least)."
"Uff🔥 the intro, so magical✨ ❤"
"Apple could re-think the touch-bar. I still love it. The longer i've sat with it, the more power and opportunity has come for me. I know this video is not related to the touch-bar at all but noticing the things that Apple brought back–more ports, magsafe. I'd be we'll see touch-bar back and better in the future...OR by that time finally a touch-screen Mac?"
wow the quality was exceptional
"I disagree about the whole wait to upgrade thing. The same people were saying that back in summer 2021, saying things like ""stop waiting just get a macbook pro if you need one"" and ""the current ones are great"". yeah, well i waited until the very day the 2021 m1 macbook pros dropped and placed my order. Have zero regrets. 
If you believe there is something good on the horizon, like a big leap forward in computing performance/efficiency, wait it out and see! Don't jump the gun on an inferior laptop (like i almost did with an intel mbp)."
As a data scientist I can say the original M1 is still plenty for everything I do. It would be nice to have some more ram bu other than that its been amazing. I kind of want to upgrade to the m2 max tho
"Great review, Marques! You hit all the key points. These Macs are great to have available for those who need 'em."
Not sure if it's worth spending the $$ to go from my Macbook Pro 13 M1 to and M2.
"I just wish they made the 16 inch in a more basic/cheaper spec. I like having  a large screen, but I simply do not need performance in a laptop, and I am convinced that most buyers do not need it either."
"I’m glad I didn’t make any ultimatum that if Apple didn’t get rid of the camera notch on their Apple Macbook M2 laptop that I’d wear no underwear for a day. 😅 Might consider purchasing the laptop but then again the M2 Mac Mini seems more ideal for the multiscreen monitors I find to be necessary. Yet again, when traveling…the laptop is nice but that’s what the iPad is for and it’s integratabtle wireless keyboard. The iMac with M2 Pro Max, a wireless keyboard with the extended and integrated numbers on the side and the touchscreen mouse built in or with a “magsafe” magnetic attachment design would be even better. What do I know? 🤷🏻‍♂️"
"I've got a 2021 MPB M1Pro with 16 GB RAM and since then, multiple times, said that this was a mistake. This is mainly due to Apple not fixing the audio crackling bug that is related to memory usage and memory pressure. As soon as I am using more than 50%, and that is just by having Discord, Music and a web browser running, I have the audio issues. I'm cannot imagine doing ""real work"" on this machine with only 16 GB."
What an intro dang 🔥
Been a minute since I’ve been on the channel but happy I came back for this one. I just took the plunge and copped the M2 Max 16” to replace my burned-out 15” late 2016 Touch Bar. This vid reassured I made the right choice! 🔥 Hilarious seeing how you repurposed that Mac Pro trash can… I’ll never forget seeing you while I was working at the Genius Bar back when your machine also burned-out!
"man that intro, and sound design is very good"
Imagine apple purposely kept the notch JUST to see him wear socks and sandals 🤪😂
What about its repairs and spare parts?
Diggin the socks w/sandals look! Apple probably left the notch just to call you on your bluff
"hi, when you turn-on/restart your mac after you login, is it giving you some kind of loading bar or abit of flcker screen before going to home main page?"
Insane intro and sick transition 🔥🔥😍... The skimming over the story board or timeline in final cut Pro was awesome 🔥
Great work 👏🏾
"I tried a macintosh laptop once before. It was seriously frustrating. I definitely wouldnt call them user friendly. Even windows is getting bad,since theyve released Win11. Its like they're trying hard to make both os's the same or very similar."
Thank u Bro it was great♥️
personally I was hoping for improved x86 eemulation (so yuou could natively boot windows). I miss bootcamp on macbooks
"A MAN OF HIS WORD. That's why I watch him. 
Thanks Marques!"
"I was worried about buying the M1 MacBook Pro 14"" a couple months ago because I knew a refresh was around the corner. But after watching this video, I have no regret at all."
Intros are getting better. Also got Gerald undone vibes 🤪🤪
"Damn, your recent intros are sick💪💪💪💪"
@Marques what would you suggest for a uiux designer a 16 inch or 14 inch? Great video as always :)
This channel is an absolute gift to YouTube
"I just got mine it is so awesome, does anyone know where to get that wallpaper from?"
"I was genuinely waiting to see if he was going to honor his socks and sandals promise, and he didn’t disappoint."
Superb intro and a perfect outro
"said… they should’ve made the M2 Pro variety in Space Gray. That’s a way better look for the mini, and I’m disappointed the Mac Studio didn’t also get that darker color."
Can you please do some reviews on windows laptops?
"I'm glad they aren't using the touch bar and use the M1 models' design here so much, I've been thinking about going from a T480 to a macbook pro but the current M2 models look meh.
Could get an M1 max macbook pro instead, but I don't upgrade hardware often so if I do it has to be the latest."
Thanks a lot for the info!
The studio channel makes me appreciate these insane intros even more. I watched the intro 4 times to catch the details.
What an opening scene. WOW
that intro 🔥🔥🔥
Is the Mac studio gonna come out with an m2 version?? I’m looking to buy that but there’s no point if a newer 1 coming soon
Another great review! I don’t know how you do it!
"Marques, I am trying to reach Apple about there ""Voice Control"" feature under ""Accessibility"" within ""Settings"". Can you help?? Apple is two steps behind the industry standard, i.e., Dragon NaturallySpeaking (DNS), and as a quadriplegic it would be hugely helpful if they could prioritize improving the accuracy and expanding the capabilities of their voice recognition software. Currently, I have to run Windows on windows parallels to be able to use DNS when I would prefer just to use Voice Control with iOS."
Man that intro plus transition!! Team at the studio never disappoints
MKBHD should honestly start doing trailers and marketing for tech brands with this level of production quality cause honestly wow
"Returning mine. I was happier with my 2017 version, and it had twice as many thunderbolts."
"I'm still using my MacBook Pro (Retina, Mid 2012) with 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 and an Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB. Most impressive iwa the battery with  aattery cycle count of 1523. 
I'm still hesitant to change this to anything else. What others think should I change or should I stay with my 11 yrs old MacBook pro?"
"Love your sense of humor :) 8:03 haha you are right, I don't think that in the 2027 we will get the new one because the world crisis, so, totaly accept that we should enjoy the new one in these days :) BTW nice Linux stile with socks and flip flops"
Oh the production quality has taken a big ol’ leap
"that intro was so impressive, their investment into robots, production and equipment is insane!!"
Great review and all but I'm trying to figure out how you got your tripod mounted camera to pan down like a human is controlling it @9:08? Magic
Any idea if they improved the card reader speeds?
Thx for the solid information. Tough break on the socks and sandals routine 😂
My only concern with Macs and MacBooks nowadays is longevity. My first iMac lasted ten years before it got too slow and couldn't handle new OS upgrades. My 2016 MacBook Air is just starting to struggle with new OS features. I rely on my computers for work and I want something that I know will keep running for a decade. I love Apple products but their constant upgrades bum me out sometimes. I appreciate they want people to upgrade every few years but don’t forget about those of us that need longevity.
"I want one, but just hate the notch so much.  Might have to get a Mini instead."
I watched the Intro using my presonus speakers and I had to watch it like 5 times. It is awesome and so satisfying. Keep doing the good work Marques and team.
"Marques, what’s your opinion on the information coming out 2020 M1 MacBook Pros are being scrapped because of the crazy Apple activation lock??!!"
That intro 🔥
"I don’t know about the M2 MBPMFPower in this review, but talking about the common and cheapest version that majority gonna buy, M2 Pro 512GB, I didn’t hear anything about the SSD, cause is slower compare the previous M1, and we r talking about 40$ worth maximum. Really really bad! Anyway, always appreciate your job. Peace"
I watched the short of studio and now I am watching this video just cause of intro i am so so so thrilled I also want that robot 🥺🥺🥺it is soooooo sick
"Watching All the way from Africa, Zambia 🇿🇲 Your intro is just something I wouldn't  miss.. lol"
"I got an 16” M1 Max 32GB off eBay about a week ago. It was a pretty good deal too. I’ll hang on to this one for a while. Coming from the 13” M1, the huge trackpad is messing with me. I find myself accidentally activating shortcuts because my palm rests on it. I do really miss my Touch Bar though."
That was a good ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro your delivery is top notch
"8:05 😂👏🏼 Totally agree. At the current state of technology, every new generation is incremental. Wait for microLED in 2028! 😅🤣"
"ah yeah, it would be quite an upgrade from my 15,4"" Late 2008 MBP. (I'm not joking)"
Just so we are clear. Is your definition of light bleed when a weak but noticeable amount of light is surrounding a light object on a black background? Because thats a big Issue with my iPad pro 12.9” 😕
"I understand that YouTubers often use computers for video rendering, but it's always the main example for performance, when it doesn't really matter for most of the users and especially when it's 30 vs 20 seconds now."
"shoutout to your sound designer, he did a good job and that audio tag for the logo at the intro sounds *mwah* on my speakers"
"I feel bad having to watch this video on my 2gb ram windows vista pc in 360p, because I can't fully enjoy Marques' amazing editing - my phone is worse, double sorry. Still you're my favorite channel and I really enjoy tech stuff despite life and man, I loved this review! It's insane where we are now in terms of quality in these products. And you Marques bring out the beauty of them in your vids. Bless!"
I have been waiting for your review most of all 🎉🎉
"The writing of these videos are so on point it feels like he is having a spontaneous conversation with the audience. This is so hard to pull off!

BUT: It's not proper sandal shame if you aren't wearing white socks on black sandals. Wearing black socks is cheating!"
Since nothing is upgradeable. if you have a hardware problem with the m1 or m2's laptop can they be fixed or do you toss the m1 or m2 computer away if you do not have applecare on it
"I am seeing marques from past 6 years the quality and progression is astonishing, the only tech channel i love to watch. Always on point."
"In India, the highest specd version M2 Max 96GB will cost a whopping ₹429,900 or $5274 🙄"
"THIS is black EXCELLENCE !
He is not perfect, but fair and obviously hardworker.
Should be a role model for a lot of young people out there !"
Marques review video is like a movie tech teaser from Netflix u know
The bet should’ve been wearing sandals everytime he records until Face ID is added 😂
"If I didn’t care about gaming PCs and laptops, I would definitely pick this up"
"Beautifully put together. A masterpiece. Must be a lot of work behind the scenes, I suspect."
Can somebody tell me the brand of Marques's long sleeve please? The video is awesome as always!
One of the sickest intros I've ever watched. 10/10 <3
"need to buy a laptop for my son starting his BEng soon.Will this be an ideal laptop for an engineering grad?
Does it run Solidworks etc stuff?"
Orphan concern?   Difference between mid 2014 MacBook Pro and the M1 Pro (both 14 inch) is weight distribution.   M1 Pro is much cooler as a lap held device but the screen feels heavier in relation to the keyboard and I have to be somewhat  more careful about balancing it if my wrists aren't actually resting on it.  Has that changed with the M2 Pro?
"Cool intro, and by the way I think a video on Notion from MKBHD would be cool."
"Your crew is so good. That intro, the overall production, the fact that your VO sounds like ADR at times...Too clean!

Now, to the meat and potatoes...You said ""Like Linus"". Linus does not wear slides. You are essentially wearing what you wear after UF practice. Could have made a short about calling Linus to see what he buys, going to Walmart to actually buy them, then leaving with them on."
"Please do test MBP 14” - M2 Max- 30c GPU - 32gb - 1 TB vs 14” - M2 Max- 30c GPU - 64gb - 1 TB for video editing 4K -  6K also test with different codecs native and ProRes Raw. Test with applications such as Premiere Pro, FCP, DaVinci Resolve and After Effects. Thank you"
Wondering if it can perfect match lgc2 for 4k120fps now😮
The quality of these intros and reviews is off the chart. Are these other channels even competing with this?
The ending tho ❤
Here for the Dope Intro 🔥🔥
"Yea tech is gonna change and improve in matter of days and months, so if you really need a machine you can't wait forever 👍🏽"
the opening....OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG ITS WAS GREAT
"Holy crap, that intro has more production value than some of the Apple's own promotional videos."
Quality sensible review.
I love his Intro ⚡❤️☠️🙏🏻
Extremely Amazing Apple New MacBook Pro M2 Max Video by you MKBHD as always.....👽👻😉😉
The quality of cinematography just keeps on climbing 🔥🔥🔥
"Thanks Marques on the conclusion ""if you should wait"""
"woow what a start,  who ever make the entrance of this video deserve a rise man"
I just got mine. Moving from an intel pro. What a freaking difference
What about virtualization? Can we still run Linux VMs to build your lab environments.
"As they say at Paul's Hardware. ""Excellent"""
thank you Marques for inspiring me to wait for M5 max
"My i7 late 2013 pro 15"" still works flawlessly and I have a late 2019 i9 pro as a back up. I'm good for at least 7more years."
The intro was so dope i watched it 2 times 🤣🤣
"Q3 2027 new MacBooks confirmed! But in all seriousness, loved that opening shot."
It would be nice to compare to some new AMD notebooks.
Watching on my M1 Pro Macbook 👀
That intro transition to video was outrageously smooth
"thanks for the review Marques, all the way to the end with the socks and sandals 😂"
Probably going to upgrade but I still love my 2018 MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. So many hated on the Touch Bar but I do like it.
"I ordered the baseline 2023 14"" MacBook Pro coming up from the 2015 13"" MacBook Pro which now gets very hot just watching YouTube. Definitely my time to catch up to y'all rich lot who like to upgrade every 1 or 2 years (!!!)."
"Need some help on deciding on a new MacBook: I'm currently running my old dad's 15,4, 16GB late 2012 MacBook Pro. Absolutely love it with it's ports, runs smooth etc but software support has ended since ~2020

I'm on top first semester architecture student and we're soon starting ArchiCAD etc. I'm planning on getting the 16' Macbook Pro in base configuration (16GB, 512GB) but not sure if that is enough power for working with it consistently the next years-decade. Does anyone has any experience or advice on that topic? Thx in advance <3"
2:35 using the old Mac Pro as a plant pot lol 😂
"It's been years till I've hold a laptop, and when i had the M1 max MBP 16'' on my hands it was heeeeavy !! It's incredible how heavy it can be, when years ago they were thinner and lighter."
"My wife wanted a MacBook, so I got her a MacBook Air with the M1 chip. She doesn't use it for video or photo or games, and she loves it. No need to upgrade. Me, on the other hand, I got my older generation MacBook air for free and use it occasionally. Despite Apple releasing the same thing year after year after year, if their design doesn't break, they're not going to fix it."
I would like to see some comparisons to some relevant hardware. the processors in cinebench it was compared to are not really relevant and just make the M2 Pro/Max look better than it is
is this good for gaming? i’m new to this.
Should I get the M2 Max 14-inch or keep my similar spec M1 Max 16-inch? I'm still in the return window lol
I’m still rocking a mid 2009 MacBook Pro. It’s been to war four times.
"Dude... I had a 2011 MBP for almost ten years. hahaha upgraded to a 2016 mbp touch pro, $500, which eventually died because of some transducer, (got it repaired), and it's back up and running- anywho long story short my upgrade should be in 2026, but I might do it sooner than expected."
Apple really needs to optimize their products for gaming
The sickest intro so far!!
Man of my word 😂💕 love it 😄👍
The optical computer is going to be terrifying.
The new INTRO is crazy good <3
"A dev on my team got the new M1 mac a little bit ago, still causes issues when trying to install certain coding libraries needed to run things locally. Curious to see how that improves with time."
"Gotta love the old Mac ""bin"" in the background 😂"
Good video but would still rather have a win / linux laptop because of price / ease and price of repair / upgradability...
When production outshines the MacBook itself
im sorry but Ive watched that intro like a dozen times that was sick haha
Where can I find that purple wallpaper you have on the Mac?
I was in idle mode going through my watch later playlist until that intro made me jump out of my seat. You guys (and gals) make some mind-blowing stuff.
Great video dude! On point homie!
what an intro! Kudos to the shooter and the editor!
"I have m1 MacBook Pro, this machine is awesome."
"i have an Imac 27"" late 2013 and it's still runs like new, I've changed the hard drive for a 1tb ssd and added RAMS and now have 24gb RAM. It's a 10 years old computer but i can still edit contents on final cut and i can still record stuff in Logic. but it's not 4k and doesn't have USB C ports. I am thinking of getting a new mac but can't decide between an macbookpro 16"" or wait for the new IMAC M3 coming in late 2023. The mac studio is too expensive for me but i wonder if the new IMAC will be larger because the 24"" is too small for me."
"My MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017) Ram 16 GB 1TB HDD is about to die. I use huge files on keynote, as a meaning task, secondary  video editing, what computer do you recommend getting ?"
"Received my work issued M1 Max machine on the same day that they announced the M2 Max lol The improvement over my 2019 macbook pro has been incredible. Code compiles twice as fast, the time savings in the last week have been awesome."
"Great machines. I won't be buying those either. Last time I bought a MacBook Pro, I could upgrade RAM and SSD without paying the Apple Fee because they were not soldered on. 400 bucks to upgrade from 16 to 32GB of RAM. 200 bucks for 1TB instead of 512GB. 600 bucks total on top of already an expensive price just to have the specs it should already have. For upgrades that in a PC it wouldn't cost you anywhere near that with top-notch components. Let alone if we discount the value of the already present RAM modules and SSD. It just feels like those telephone ""scams"" in which they take advantage of the ignorance of the elderly to make them agree a contract with very bad conditions. But you can't really call them scams and hence illegal because they were technically correct with you about the conditions and the price."
What sort of user upgrades can be done on Apple's M series PCs?
Intro : Back to Goosebumps!
Any music producers here? I’m thinking of getting the 96GB ram version as I’ll be using a lot of ram intensive plugins. You reckon 64GB will be all I’ll need or should I plunge for the 96GB version?
He mkbhd your video quality is out of the YouTube world amazing ❤️
"Half of the time, am here for the heads up (updates) and enjoying the video quality (I notice and appreciate the cuts camera angles shooting techniques all that juice best believe) it’s about time people’s hard work deserve flowers while they are alive chao.🙏🏿👏🏿😉"
I feel like MKBHD has the best intro music
that was the cleanest and coolest into ever
How is x86 emulation with this extra horsepower? Can you run x86 windows decent?
"Dude, I like that you are not talking in ""slo smo"" like many other uutuubers...that tells your brain works the same speed as mine. No need to 2x or skip content. Anyhow, my main Apple machine is still the M1 Air (512/16), and have been very fine with it. Imho one of the best computer buys ever. I've been in computers from the '90's 👍"
I come back to this video all the time just to watch that intro
I saw the intro on my laptop screen and speakers at first and stopped and loaded up the video on my 4K TV and sound system to get the full experience. I love it!
Wow the intro was just awesome.
Is the 16 inch MacBook too big to be traveling with? Like does it take up a lot of space to place in a carry on or if you wanted to sit it on your lap on a plane?
I'm here for the glorious intro
I didn’t really care much for the actual review because I was appreciating that sweet intro transition and editing. Top job team.
Awesome video. What about dual monitor?
I always have a big smile on my face every time I watch a new MKBHD video. Love from 🇳🇬
What do you think of apps like CleanMyMac/MacKeeper? Do these apps really improve Macs or are they unnecessary?
BROO THE INTRO WAS 🔥🔥🔥🔥
What do you think of the Lenovo yoga 9i?
♥️♥️♥️awesome laptop ♥️
That intro 🥶
The intro of your camera work and the end♥️.. u nailed it🔥
"Great hardware but you didn't mention the lack of Intel, they can't run windows, Visual Studio Community, SQL Server, PCVR or Steam games (unlike Intel Macs). This makes them largely useless if you can't do everything you need to M1."
The intro bro 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
wow great review
"You gotta wear the white socks + linus sandal combo, Marques. For the memes"
Sometimes I wish that TV on my country (Cuba) had the quality of MKBHD. Thanks for casting
I got the 16” MacBook Pro M1 Max last year so I’ll _actually_ be waiting to upgrade until 2027 for M5 😆
At this point Marques beating Apple with those beautiful intros
That was one of the hardest intros I’ve ever seen!
I am looking at one only mistake I feel is paying price for it but is it worth the price
So I just bought one. Question. Is anyone sure the lid of the laptop is still metal? It feels plastic. Apple seems to not say
But does it do duel screen?
"Been wanting to upgrade from my 2013 MacBook Pro, super pumped about the ports returning. Can’t wait to get my hands on one."
What an intro!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
"What’s a the better size for owning, the 14 or the 16 I’m trying to get into cybersecurity/ coding  so this would be my first mac. Thanks in advance"
the intro and the sandals at the end...... kudos
"8:00
bro thanks for the advice because I kinda hesitated when you mentioned it but now I feel more confident that I'm not gonna regret spending more than 2500$!
thanks, dude!"
Where does this guy get his wallpapers from? They're amazing
I love how he never disappoint us with his content 💐
its time for apple to make their events edited by creators. imagine        Apple Event x MKBHD x Peter McKinnon
"Man, that intro? Spectacular 🥵"
Any ideas about the black hoodie brand Marques is wearing?
I personally don't like the MagSafe. They are too tough to maintain. I also prefer the touch bar.
Wow great video! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
"I've watched the intro over and over again, but I still can't get tired of it."
"The intro took the editors 80% of the time for this video and 20% for the rest haha.
That's the Mac Pro in the background is now a flowerpot?? lol"
"Heat, talk about heat!! Does this boil over like the M2 air?"
Dope wallpaper! where can I get it?
I WISH I WAS THIS TALENTED AT MAKING VIDS💞💞 SUCH GREAT CONTENT AS ALWAYS
"Anyone has a link to that purple space wallpaper? 

Many thanks"
"The M2 and the M2 Max MacBook Pro is really useful for doing your online work, editing and more other useful things. I wouldn’t say it’s great for gaming as most steam games don’t support the newer apple MacBook devices. Awesome video though reviewing the M2 Marques!"
That intro was insane.
The top notch design joke had me.. 😂
The intro is fire
"My new MacBook M2 Pro has exceeded all my expectations. The speed and responsiveness are unmatched by any other laptop I've owned before. The powerful 10th-generation Intel Core processor makes multitasking a breeze. And did you know that the MacBook M2 Pro has a long battery life of up to 18 hours, allowing you to work all day without needing to plug it in."
"Man that robot arm flex at the top. so sick,"
That intro was smoother than the MacBook's aluminium
Yoooo that intro was mad cool ....keep uping the production my guy been here since the begining
MAN OF YOUR WORD!!! Earned my respect yet again.
"It’s time for a MacBook Pro 14” with M1 Max, baby!!!!!!"
"I’m curious, how come the cinebench results for single and multi core scores are against older cpus, I saw an i7 7700k some 11th Gen intel laptops, older xenon chips 1st Gen Ryzen and threadripper, why not any 12th or 13th gen intel or anything from Ryzen 5000 or 7000?"
The Intro kills everthing!
We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content ...
"im keeping my m1 with the touch bar.
i didnt want it before i had it, but i wont give it away for a few more percent of power. much more useful than 20 seconds less waiting...."
"Would do a review 1 month before Mother’s Day every year? About the best price point of the apple lineup? Like best at $3k, $2500, $2k, $1500, $1k? For enthusiasts and for just regular browser users? Would like to buy a tech gift around Mother’s Day"
Beautiful intro
"What mk dont want to show you in his cinebench charts is that direct competitor to m2 max , the Intel Core i9-12900HX is 50 % faster in multicore..."
I still use my Mid 2012 MacBook Pro!!! 😆😆😆..... These things are expensive.... The only reason I have it is because Full Sail University sent them to music production students.  I do want a new MacBook though.
That plant holder behind you looks very nice - hope it wasn’t too expensive 😬
They should have added dynamic island there
"Не вижу смысла переходить на новый Мак. Это типо как ваша машина могла ехать 250 км/ч, а новая модель может 350 км/ч. И как часто ты будешь использовать все 350 км/ч ?))) С таким же успехом можно купить корм для носорога или космический скафандр, вдруг когда-нибудь пригодиться)))"
"Suddenly, my Intel-based 16-inch MacBook Pro laptop seems old."
How does this compared to a PC in the same price range? Is this processor really that worth it? How is the gpu compute speed? If they are going to sell us something at a premium price and not have a way for us to fix it then these new processors better be that damn good
My MacBook is from 2013 😅 (but using an M1 for work and love it)
"My school sent me the M1 MacBook Pro 16”. I have never liked macs being a PC guy myself, but damn…these things are impressive for video editing. Really blown away by how good these are."
"Not gonna lie, this new MacBook didn't even need a review. It feels like I'm watching the previous MacBook review. 
Still amazing production quality on your end MKBHD, good work!"
"I am not sure if this is a right metaphor, but I saw a comments about m2 pro and max in the other clips that said that M1 pro and max were like Samsung Galaxy S2 while M2 pro and Max were like Samsung Galaxy S3."
Better intro than apple!
I don't think I can ever understand wanting a MacBook. Mostly cause I like gaming. And I'm studying engineering. Two things that are incompatible with a MacBook.
Can’t believe mkbhd didn’t make it into the apple event :/
"as soon as I saw the thumbnail, the first thing that came to my mind was MKB's first statement ""I've been using this M2 max Macbook Pro for over a week now and here's my first impressions"""
"No shade to MacOS, but as a Linux dev, would love Apple to help the Asahi Linux team getting hw accel and prop drivers working.  Would love to replace my x86 laptop with the m1/m2"
"Regarding the synthetic benchmarks, I want to point out that there are other faster processors out there:

On Geekbench you said ""the single core score is the highest I've ever seen"". The M2 is not the fastest single-threaded score out there, though I can't argue what you have/haven't run yourself. The i9-13900K scored a 2237 single-core score and the Ryzen 9 7950X scored a 2192, vs your M2 2058.

On Cinebench you said it has a chart-topping score, but there are much faster scores for single threaded benchmarks as well. The i9 13900KS scored 2326 and the Ryzen 9 7950X scored 2043, vs your M2 1703.

Not that the M1 and M2 are bad chips, they're very fast and power-efficient as well (typing this on an M1 MBP) but there are faster processors out there and I feel like this video is a little misleading.

Otherwise a great video as always!"
DAMN MKBHD THAT INTRO
"Reading the comments, I agree, the intro was amazing as per usual, but starting to think that it distracts everyone from discussing or even paying attention to the actual video ."
It's the last part for me 😂😂😂🙌🙌🙌
Here I am...still running my 2015 Macbook Pro. Still running like a champ. Cannot wait to upgrade to the M2 Max and have it last forever.
"Unpopular opinion: I actually love the touchbar and use it all the time for taking screenshots, volume and brightness sliders, easy access to VOIP apps controls, app drawer access etc"
"We don't watch MKBHD for the consumer tech, we watch him for the aesthetics."
Damn that intro got me feeling some type of way 😏🤙🏼
Your camera crew are Gods compared to any Hollywood blockbuster. TOP NOTCH
I need to upgrade from my mid 2014 MacBook Pro retina with a maxed i7. It’s limping along at this point.
"Just stumbled upon this channel. Editing quality 🔥
Really great content.I've never witnessed such awesome editing as this one. You got a new sub"
That last point was so necessary for me to hear😂
Way to follow through with the socks and sandals!
"It is that robotic arm, put to use. Good intro"
I heard M30 will be really good in like 30 years
"Hi question would you buy a Apple  MacBook Pro (2021)  M1 Max 32GB 1000GB SSD 14.2"" over a M2 13” Mac Book Pro 24GB 1000GB. Ps they are for sale for about the same price. My needs are to make 360 videos  Thx your help is massively appreciated"
I really appreciate that intro man. Nicely done.
"HOLY SHIT THE PRODUCTION AND HIS PROFESSIONALISM AS A ""TV"" PRESENTER..... RIPS LIKE M2MAX"
i don't care how good the M2 max is. i need my touch bar.
that intro... wow!
"8:33 I wouldn’t say for sure that 2027 is definitely 30% better since it has been proven that tech is not always like that e.g. if anyone remembers Intel’s Pentium 4 and the smallest MacBook with Intel’s Core M processor and the revolutionary Apple’s Butterfly keyboard…tech will screwup along the way, that’s how human being works."
Good YouTube channel  and good video.
Production is through the roof 🔥
"I can't wait for my work machine (maxed out i9 16"") to come up for replacement in a few months, these things are so, so much faster and don't wind up cooking themselves under anything harder than web browsing.

Imagine that statement 5 years ago! Looking forward to ditching an absolute top of the line i9 for a tiny ARM chip that's basically a bunch of really fancy smartphone processors glued together because the i9 is too slow, hot and power hungry. I don't love any company, and I certainly don't love Apple, but I couldn't see myself getting a non-Apple laptop at this point. Desktop is still Windows for gaming, but the M1/M2 is just objectively better for mobile devices in every way - unless you have to pay for your laptop, holy shit are they expensive"
8:00 That upgrade roast for all the nerds… ugggh man that was so solid. 🤣
I’m still running mac book pro mid 2014 😂
Best intro so far 😦🤯
I love how the trash can Mac Pro becomes the plant pot in the background. 😂
"Man, your intros keep getting better and better!"
"""I'll wear sandals and socks for a day"" lowest stakes ever xD"
My boy rockin the socks and slides!!! He's a real one!
What’s the LG TV model that you are using?
"For environmental preservation,  why are we still not able to send our M1s back to them to swap the internals if it's the same design still?   Boggles my mind.  I'm still rocking  a pristine  17 inch macbook maxed out in late 2011.  Someone would have to gift me one of these for me to upgrade. No thanks. What?!"
"for anyone looking for the best value, last gen model will always be a better value for money, or just buy the m1 macbook air, its the best deal there is"
"I can’t even imagine what I’d do with 96GB RAM on a MacBook. 32GB feels like a lot. I love seeing Apple growing into its silicon. It’s amazing how much Intel and Broadcom were holding us back. 

With the advances in AI accelerating, and VR right around the corner, I wonder if we will see more focus on the GPU advancements in Apple silicon for M3 and beyond."
"For environmental preservation,  why are we still not able to send our M1s back to them to swap the internals if it's the same design still?   Boggles my mind.

Just here to appreciate the into🎥🙌
"Sign me up when they get a iMac Pro again,  with a m2 ultra chipset... 😆... That would be my ideal little editing station for Resolve."
"In the UK the 14” MBP starts at £2149 ($2,650) which is an around 20% increase of £300 ($370} over the M1 version, the 16” starts at £2,669 ($3,291) I think Apple is out of touch with the economic situation TBH and makes it really hard to justify in the UK"
"Everything now is PERFECT, but I need Face ID! And then take my money"
How does it handle heating when used for rendering long videos or graphics etc?
Would this MacBook pro with 96gb ram be good for Houdini?
I wish they had the Touch Bar. What does it hurt to have it? If you dont like it just dont use it! but its so useful how it changes with every app.
Sweet intro!
"That's a sandal, but we need you to wear THE Linus' sandals 👍"
Great video
"that intro was at the level of an apple product presentation, never seen anything this professional before"
Random video -i wonder how Chadwick become tech pro like Suri
"Have they fixed the issue with M1 Pro 14/16 draining the battery and taking hours to a day to recognize the charger? You said no one bought this version laptop and regretted it... Not being able to use your laptop at all was a big regret with mine. I rarely use it, 50 charge cycles since new [10/21/21], everything is mint and this is a known issue with no real explanation. Still dealing with this to this day."
Love 💗 from India🇮🇳
You make Linus proud lol
"I thought the m2 mac was gonna be fast, but turns out a i5 12600k which is 220 dollars and a rx 6600 also 220 dollars paired together is faster."
"as always, the production here is awe-inspiringly phenomenal, but i have one tiny, grating little complaint: that ""click"" sound (2:29) is *really* goddamn annoying. idk maybe it's just me but every time it played throughout the video i died a little inside lmao"
loving the plant that's been potted in a og mac pro 💀
Which size SSDs are the fastest ? For 14” 16” M2 max
That Intro 😦
其实接口外观处可以做的圆润一些，我相信以苹果出色的工业设计能力完全可以办到!
"Are they good for games like assassin creed, etc"
"Great Video! Getting my M2 Pro MBP tomorrow in the Mail <3 Any chance we could get a link to that wallpaper, it looks really great! Keep up the good work"
I am really curious how Intel is going to compete with Apple at least in their marketing of the value they offer customers over Apple. Would love to hear some Intel folks thoughts
Wtf are these intros?😭 How do they keep getting better
I feel attacked by the end 😂😂.. wearing them rn
Can someone tell me how to create that effect of the Apple Logo being highlighted and then transitions to MKBHD closing tyhe lid. Tyhe was a incredile intro
But can it run Safari? haha without destroying the ram haha
"The sandals reveal was epic, not to mention you had so much style and swagger with them on. You are one trendy dude Marques"
"He is getting 100k views per hour

It's been 19 hours and he's got 19 million views🥰🥰🥰
Amazing🤗🤗"
Apple should totally add an RGB edge light to the logo.
"why didn’t  apples press release show footage of you mkbh the most popular tech you-tuber  in the world? i was confused about that, also upset! and then they show these other creators no one has ever heard of? lol"
"8:03 Maques said I should wait to 2027, thank you Marques :)"
Where can I find the pink space wallpaper?
"Marques, you cannot convince me that you didn’t just put your socks and slides on only for that single shot 9:10 and then immediately took them off. We’re gunna need a whole day vlog bro 😂"
"… so they’re basically the same as the last ones. Really, you’ll barely notice a difference if you’re not told which one you’re using (M1 pro/MAX vs M2 versions)."
Mate just sits there and talks casually and I'm hanging on to every word. How does he do it?
Intel 13980HX is over 30k in geekbench.
"I don't want to minimize what they do well in this industry, but only Apple could remove the ports saying it's an innovation, and then put them back, saying it's...an innovation."
That introduction OMG
The intro just shocked me great job 😊
I stopped watching the video after the Intro just to come to the comments to admire this great video production! They are definitely getting good at using that robot!🙂👌
You’re wearing ASRV? Hell yeah 👊
"Awesome content. I just subscribed, but if you are interested in cool lighters, click on the lighter flame."
i just got my m1 pro in august last year and i absolutely love it but now i am wondering if a switch is needed or not please tell
BEST INTRO EVER!
"Please do a video on the matter standard for home devices marques, it would be really useful"
"I think the SSD’s in the M2 are under performing the M1 by 50%. Yes, the m1 ssd is way faster than the M2’ s"
"You say this is more for people who own older macbook laptops. I own a late 2013 MBP, and went onto the apple store website to see what trade in deal I could get. Basically, they said recycle it. I can understand it probably be worthless to aple as it's 10 years old, but as a potential buyer of a new M2 Macbook pro they they should be giving an incentive to me to buy it.  the cost of the m2 max with 38 core gpu is almost £500 more than the previous m1 max with 32 core gpu. That's a lot of money increase wise and then not offer any incentive to an older macbook owner to go and buy one."
I wonder how many times that robotic camera arm has already paid for itself…
"I am so happy that these new MacBooks came out now I can finally get the last generation 16 in MacBook Pro at a discounted price. I am not a professional editor, so I do not need that excessive amount of power from the M2 pro

 the M1 Pro will last me at least a decade"
"...were those really socks and sandals though? Slides are one thing, you see people slipping on those all the time to go places. I was expecting those strappy things like Teva sandals that he wears. But hey, hopefully you enjoyed the time."
It’s nice that he didn’t forget about the Socks and Sandals bet and owned up to having to wear them. A lot of other people would just act like that didn’t happen
"By far the biggest issue with these is the fact that no one (literally no one) is producing docker containers for the Mx line, which means you can't realistically use these as development machines. Sadly it's forcing me and other developers to Windows machines."
"I thought for a moment that he forgot his claims, but he remembered, I was just wanted to twit it, but here we come
The man of the word !"
"90% of comments in this comment sections are about how good the intro was, while 10% is about the content of the video/about the laptop lmaooo"
Why's no one talking about the fact that Marques stood by his words and wore socks with sandals. I give him credit for being true to his viewers.
i still using macbook pro13 iwht m1 chip. and is still very good
I love how Apple creates a problem they never had in the first place only to solve it again by doing what worked in the first place!
MagSafe is cool but imagine if they put more actual useful ports on the laptop instead of taking up room for a charger when it can already charge through the other ports.
"The whole comment section talks about the Production...😌 
It's THAT GOOOOOD!!!! And that's an awesome Loaded laptop, which I won't be able to get my hands on it..."
I’ll buy it when it can run steam games.
"Marques put too much effort into production just to say, 'its the same, but just a little better'"
"This macbook pro is maxed out though. Could we do one with the basic model. Whats the use if everything is maxed up, its perfomance ofc will look inflated when you are spending couple of grand more"
Absolutely insane intro 🔥
Funny how now the generational upgrades have less new stuff and differences than the iPhone 6 and 6s used to have…how can this be called a viable upgrade 😂
Marques I add a chance on getting apple laptop or a Dell the price around 1500.00 dollars. I went for Dell inspiron because it was more powerful for the work I needed which is DJing.
Just try rendering a simple blender scene in that 😅
I'd ask everyone to check out MacBook repair channels and see how Apple treats you
The first thing when I saw the thumbnail I remembered about his challenge🤭
That has to be the best intro I've ever seen in anything. Ever.
How does it compare to my Geforce RTX 3080 for gaming?
"Really good advice, wait at least 5 generations before upgrading, then you are paying for a machine that offers 150% the power.

I mean they will still be massively out performed by PC laptops, with intergrated dedicated graphics like the 3070 but hey... if you have to waste your money why not do it on a machine that is so visually identical to every other machine they've made that no one can tell what you have anyway.

In conclusion, buy an intel MacBook Air from 2012... and tell people it's an M1, they really won't notice a difference."
"Lol, Apple took it a bit too seriously with the ""top notch"" design of M series MacBooks"
"The comments are about the video production of this video not the product 😂😭. 

And as a PC fan I'm disappointed that intel and AMD are not catching up and if my account allows me in the future I'll buy a Mac Laptop the reviews are crazy!."
Is that a Mac Pro Can in the background at 4:45  which is being used as a planter.
"Every time Apple releases something new, I literally just go and check out their old products, they are wayy cheaper and better than anything in the market 😂. 
Also perfect and on point production quality Marques!!"
that socks and sandal looks real comfy! :)
"Wait a second... Those were flip flops, not sandals! And I think proper ""socks and sandals"" combo deserves white socks 😅"
"Thank you MKBHD, 20syl, and Shazam
How I Feel (20syl Remix) - PLPS
10/10 Intro.."
Top Notch Production Marques👌
what sort of monitor do you have at 6:23?
"I'm still using the cheapest base model M1 Mac Mini and this thing absolutely rips! Even with the totally gimped 8GB RAM. I still can't throw enough crap at Logic for it to start erroring out, no matter how many tracks I have going with various effects, loads of synth processing, etc.

I'm glad Apple's Mac game (and especially MBP) is back on point. I wish I needed a new MBP!"
How good is this new apple laptop for architecture preferences?
"Lmao ""top notch design"" your laugh was the rim shot"
Hi please recommend which macbook i can buy ?
Love the video. Just would like to point out that those are not sandals. Sandals have a strap at the back of the foot. Linus wears them better.
Ice lake works for me. but i will get the m3 pro 16 inch in 2024. but idk maybe the max but gotta spec it right
I love how to start this video 0:01 😍😍
"Hey Marques, could you please add gaming into your macbook reviews as well? I think the attention around it would speed things up."
"Marques those are Slides, Slippers…it’s it’s not considered as Sandals. You still owe us a sandals video 🤣❤️🔥"
"An laptop with a notch, i just cant"
The OG gang of dope intros.
I hope intel is listening to this.
Love the ‘trash’ Mac in the back holding a plant
"I will let the comments decide if I buy a 16inch M2 Max 1TB 64GB RAM Macbook Pro. I have a 2017 XPS 15 and was planning to get another but DELL has not fixed the issues after all these years....blue screen, file loss, overheat (chances of combustion because pressing sleep button doesn't put it to sleep and drains the battery and makes the the fan go crazy and making ti really dangerously hot)-->still to date these models have not fixed it. small tasks in the XPS rn takes a solid 9 seconds or more to open or freezes a bit. XPS15 current specs: 16gb ram, 1TB, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz   2.80 GHz."
Quality Quality Quality!!!! 🥰🥰🥰
That opener!!!!!! 🎉
"Can someone tell me why a Mac would ever be preferred over a Windows machine? I genuinely don't understand why I wouldn't get a high end laptop or build a desktop that can do the same and more...?

Is it really just for PS/Premier/Music type programs?"
NGL I love the Touch Bar!!!
"Video is 9 minutes long
People comments within 1 minute
Wow amazing video
You never disappoint
Top quality work"
You missed the Achilles' heel of the SSD anchor... hugely important for your audience.
All that power to play literally no games! 😂
Where can I get the wallpaper?? Pls help
"You folks always do well, but I'm really just liking this video for the socks and sandals."
*meanwhile Intel: Hold my beer..
I’m peeping that new HomePod 2 👀 2:16
"while it's true what Marques says about always waiting for new tech to come out, there are times when buying something is really dumb like a new iphone in august. there is a good time and a bad time"
Damn! My old MBP is 6% less whatever than the new model! Thank you Apple TV!
The intro caught me by surprise
"Some apple fanboy creators were saying Intel is dead, well i9 13980hx is a bit more faster than M2 Max, and I the reason I watch mkbhd is that he never predicts biased future and does paid reviews, and I thin kthe best non biased and unpredictable smartphone awards on YouTube are from mkbhd, hata of to marques for maintaining unbiased review of devices...."
Best channel YouTube tech🎉
8:02 Lmao was that a dig at you know who😂
"Been loving my M2 Air. btw Black socks and sandals don't count. You need extra dorky white sports socks with stripes, un-matching leather strapped sandals plus you have to show it all off by wearing shorts! "
*The hate towards socks and sandals needs to come to an end. There are far more hideous things you could wear that are a LOT less comfortable.👏🏼*
One day sure @apple call @mkbhd for presentation because introduction and intro going so dope. 
"They’re totally mothballing the Mac Pro, in my opinion. The intel version makes no sense compared to the things they’re doing right now. I think they’re just going to leave it and hope people sort of forget."
"Hell yeah, socks and sandals are the way to go."
Your Intros are next level!
"I got 10 years out of mid 2012 MBPr and sold it it with an hour for $300. That’s about 10% depreciation per year. I will not be upgrading my 16” M1 Pro for awhile.

Face ID I am most pissed that it is not in the studio display."
"All ports is upgraded to the lastest advance technologies available, now that's fair for your hard money spend."
I swear the intros brings me here and everything else keeps me here
How could you miss that Apple managed to avoid notch by introducing two display bumps into top bezel 🤪😂🤣
I just noticed that the old mac pro has been turned into a plant pot...
8:50 HAHAHAHAHAHA I WAS WAITING FOR IT
"C'mon Marques those ain't sandals! You've let the community, Linus and sandal wearers everywhere down 😜"
"Nobody talking about the 2013 mac pro in the background used as a plant pot. Marquees ggwp. Engineers at Apple: oh wait, that could easily be an actual plant pot."
"96 Gbs memory. Um, yes please."
"For all the power and processing, they still can't figure out how to get a camera in a bezel."
Aren’t those slippers? Im here expecting some lovely old man sandals with straps and everything 😂
What wallpaper is he using at 01:10
"Apple has these ultra performance chips that are almost twice as fast than Intel chips, they will absolutely dominate the Gaming PC/Laptops segment"
"Who is going for a fully speced out 16"" M2 Max?"
How about side by side comparison of 16 inch MacBook Pro with m2 pro chip to 16 inch MacBook Pro with m2 max chip and show everyone true value of each and if m2 max chip MacBook Pro in 16 inch worth getting. 2nd video on which macs worth getting and what trash or worth getting.
The Sickest intro Ever!
"Great M2 Max MacBook full decked out  for email, internet surfing and watching streaming content!😁  $6K."
"Again, the REAL winners are the 99% of users who are about to snag EPIC deals on the original M1 Air/Pro/Mini."
This is just an amusing observation but a quantum leap is actually a very small leap.
what the actual F… intro was the bomb 😮
"i feel like ARM hits their ceiling too fast, sadly that means  apple is now a content creator laptop who travel and need extra battery life. you can get better performance from AMD/NVIDIA/INTEL 20% increase in performance is only in benchmarks in real life hardly noticeable"
that intro tho
"Chart topping single thread against a two generation old Intel CPU. I don't know where Cinebench picks its comparison chips in that chart, but that doesn't excuse you misreading it. Don't get me wrong, the M2 is a great chip. More time in your due diligence of testing results though, please."
"M3 with 3nm process will be a complete disaster without proper cooling. Those transistors are way too small for doing transactions and operations at higher temperatures. They are more sensitive to voltage ripple and voltage spikes and that could lead to serious problems. Nowada's processors dying, even with a little bit of frequency tweaking, when is overclocked 100 or 200MHz more than its maximum turbo boost, the cpu will degrade much much faster and in the end it dies. My Q6600 Quad core cpu from the era of christus was running at 4GHz at 1.55V 9 years ago 1 year straight withou doing anything, 1 year at the absolute maximum. 1 year later, it crashed to BSOD thinking it just need some voltage boost so i went from 1.55 to 1.58, it helped for 1 month and it went to BSOD again, so i raise the voltage up to 1.6 and again, only 1 full month and BSOD again happened. So i raise the voltage even higher from 1.625 where my BIOS starts saying that im the way to far from the maximum safe voltage level for this cpu and continuing pressing F1 on the keyboard and let that pass TO 1.685V where the poor C2Q Q6600 died after few hours. I ordered brand new that year after 3 Months of crashing and i did some research what happend and i imedietely lower the clock speed and the voltage even tho my water cooling was absolute monster and cooling capacity was way wayyy above NHD15 from noctua. This PC works 8 years now, without any single BSOD and the frequency is now 3.0GHz at slightly lower voltages."
High quality USB c port....? Except when you plug USB c headphones and it takes 3 minutes to detect... Can you explain?
"Wondering why everyone is ranting against the touch bar. If someone doesn't like it just ignore it. For those who got used to it is going to be missed. I've been using macbook Pro for like a half year and the touch bar found it's place and because the functions are intuitive it becomes more and more useful. Now, I do understand that not all of us are the same, but  having the touch bar as an option is not harming anyone, but once you remove it, it's gone! Too bad Apple opted it out."
Intro hard af!!!
"Dude, this production team is mad. you guys should work on some longer shots. maybe a tech movie"
"You're assuming we're keeping up with M1 in your script. not all of us, great video though"
Sheeeesh that intro was fire
Nah Marques those are sliders not sandals😂 Need to see you in proper  Linus style sandals
"I rather take one more USB-c port instead of the HDMI or magsafe. My only complaint about M-series, (i got M1 max)."
I can't find any comparisons to the ps5 in terms of raw compute powers
Still no reason for such a huge notch
that wallpaper is dope!
"okay I am using ""1.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5"" for 2.7k video editing, long travel videos with bunch of speed rumps and more, and it sucks, the playback is choppy, cant work and feel annoyed, that when I bought that laptop people were doing reviews and said its best laptop for 4k editing, this laptop cant deal with 1080 footage with speed ramps and stuff. SO okay my girlfriend got the new ""2022 air m2"", basic model, looking at all those youtube feedbacks, looks like its a small beast that can handle 4k! wow I go to premier pro, load bunch of videos from Maldives, and wow, it actually can handle 2.7k and..... minutes later, I start colour grading, speed rumps and guess what, it sucks, its choppy, cant work like this. so now I am in Bangkok, and M2 pro 14 inch here after discounts is 1.5k GBP, and I am thinking to get one, but does ANYONE know will my footage will be choppy with pro editing ? I am still doing 2.7k as most laptops cant deal 4k editing, but does anyone really tried, and tell me honest opinion?"
My mind says yes. My bank account says Absolutely NOT
"Marques, the cinebench scores you're comparing against are 2+ generation old intel CPUs, and almost 5 year old AMD CPUs. Compared to modern CPUs, the M2 Max barely places in the top 50, and loses to $1-200 CPUs"
"Clearly the MacBooks to get are still M1 MacBook Air, M1 Pro MacBook Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pro. We can skip this generation, which is no bad thing."
bro you know they realize a chip every 2 years right
"The roman empire ruled the entire world by soldiers wearing socks and sandals.  No shame in it :)

Glad to see apple not obsessively removing ports like they have done for the last 10 years.  Yes wireless headphones won me over after some time, but we need USB ports, we simply do.  and a variety of them."
hey saw  a clip where you connected your laptop with the TV/ big Screen do you mind telling me the brand and what size was the screen? thanks
You’re still handsome with socks and sandals brother!
"Why is everyone commenting about the production value of this video and ignoring that he's talking about a $10,000 MacBook that no one needs? Like seriously, what in the bot is going on here? The comments are creeping me out and I can't put my finger on why."
watching  this on my m1
"“HDMI 2.1” is a joke.  Full featured HDMI 2.1 ports are 48Gbps full duplex connections, which means 12Gb/s per lane, four lanes FRL — and that’s in addition to enabling several newly supported features like eARC, VRR, ALLM."
The only thing that you all forget is GPU... The VEGA mac is still not comparable to some ARM laptops
The fact that a notch is even there at all is really bad considering how much they ask for a decently spec’d book @ $5600
nah doesn't count. needs to be linus' personal sandals at least
WHAT DOES A WALMART JANITOR KNOW ABOUT LAP TOPS? 😂
My old MacBook Pro will play DVDs and CDs…….
'man of my words' thing got you a like bruh ; -- )
"""They got rid of the touch bar"" 

*Looks at my Touch Bar* 🤔"
How much $ for one of these ?
is that a mac pro cylinder disguise as plant pot behind you?
"😢""just watching""how I wish I can afford to buy laptop to start my online job...😅"
That flower base bro I'm dying LOL
"I was just here for the Intro - said the guy with a ""thinkpad 4 life"" tattoo :D"
Worlds most expensive flowerpot in the background.
The ending 😂
Socks and sandals. LTT theme plays 🤣
That ending lol what a goofball.
"If you asked what song the intro is, the name of the song is PLPS - How I Feel (20Syl Remix)"
M1 Air still rocks for me..😂
Dope intro
Dope intro
Great job ......
those are slippers not sandals Marques! 😂
I already have my kidney up for sale to afford an M2 Max
My computer is from 2014. It does everything I need. But I want to upgrade so bad.
Link for the wallpaper ?
"Dr. Strange: has to do a wavy sparkly thing to teleport
Marques Brownlee: 0:16

Yes I know it’s movie magic just thought it was funny"
Marques we have the same identical maxed out MacBook Pro 😂 nice bro 🤙🏽💯
Anyone else recognize the mac trash can repurposed into a flower pot?
"MKBHD: (embarassed) am gonna socks and sandles the whole day 
The socks & sandles gang: Bro, watchu mean ""well"" we do that every day🙄"
will wait until 2030 for the M15
My 2020 m1 macbook air runs out of application memory often. Maybe I should upgrade?
"Is this the ""trash can"" mac on the window sill in the background?😂"
"Intro isn’t simple, feels like you barfed on my screen."
"Why to buy mac mini, if you can get macbook pro and get UPS and display."
Amazing
I made a mistake with buying it… cyber security professionals are left in the dust with no virtualization for x86
Here i am trying to write comments on my 2015 macbook pro with butterfly switches that constantly get stuck and a useless touchbar.
"Thanks man, please what video editor do you use?"
Still waiting for Dynamic Island to come to MacOS based machines...
Can i run Microsoft Word with that laptop?
I vote for Thong Sandals the next time you bet yourself! 😅
8:11  i disagree with his comments 3nm chip will be a game changer and it will be a while before the number is changed so yes in my opinion if u can wait a little longer wait for 3nm from hardware perspective that is a major change
Was waiting for the sandals 😂😂
great video again
imagine apple just trolling and doesn't put face id so mkbhd could wear socks and sandals
"Not a techy person here, so heres my stupid question. Is M1 tab has same power as M1 laptop?"
Nice videos wow
I am still rocking my MacBook Pro 2012
how many times you watch this video only to the intro part- yes
The guy is best tech youtuber...
that itro is dope
Thumbs just for the opening
Hot stuff from 20syl and hot stuff from da bot 🔥🔥🔥🔥
M5 - 0 nm   😱
"Comments here are 100% on how the video looks, and none on the Macbook that is supposed to be the main topic here"
"I don't hav money 💲 
& I don't understand what you are saying butt...

I am watching ❤😂😂😂😂 
My dream laptop 💻🐱"
I just wanna know what the name is of the song they used for the intro 🥲
Please review the mini ....does it connect different accessories that aren't Apple.
"I just laugh when people say ”future proofing” to computers, like yeah, you’re future proof for a year. Next yeah ”M3 Max with Wi-Fi 7”"
"Apple: Now with HDMI connector.
World:"
Like the slippers!! 🩴
"well, technically you didn't wear socks and sanda-s since those are slippers. Sandals have a closed back"
These are worth 4k where I live. 4K!
Most of the comments here focus on the video production quality rather than the actual product review.
"Whats written on the mac pro/flower pot ?
🤔"
watching m2 max review in m1 XDD
I wonder when this kind of high tech features will be available in Africa. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Once you go socks and sandals there's no going back 😅
Man of words - Marques 🤣
watching this on my 2013 trashcan macpro lmao
Do we have the name of the song in the intro? I know the artist 20syl is listed but I am unable find the song itself.
JJJust look at it ! 🤩
"I've been an Apple customer since 1991. I bought this POS yesterday and spent $2,500. Today I am returning it. I was lied to about the cables I needed, and even Apple Care couldn't help me get it set up. It is a very expensive doorstop. Apple is not the corporation it used to be. Like all others, it now doesn't ""waste money"" training employees. Apple Care used to be the best thing in the country. But they have given me incorrect info three times in the past year, and yesterday they had NO IDEA how to set up THEIR OWN COMPUTER. When a devise gets so complicated that even the manufacturer doesn't know how it works, we are in serious trouble. 😡"
tha intro!!! WOW
MKBHD intro > Apple product event
Great sound quality
I thought I was subscribed for years just realized I wasn’t somehow 😮
Intro looks so Goood!
Dude can I have this when you get your next 😂😂  my 2011 mac air just blew up. It was a sad day 😅
"It has Notch, but no Face ID... WTF APPLE???"
Just wanted glowing logo back 😅
"Cool MacBook, but can it play crisis on max settings?"
"No one is talking about the cost of these machines and lack of upgradability....yeah, talk about that."
I am on the 2019 intel 16 inch. I find no need to update until the M4 Max
I wish they made some improvements when closing the MacBook. The prints of keyboards on the screen are annoying every time I open it. I don't put anything on top of my MacBook.
I bet that those socks and sandals feel pretty good on your feet right about now. 😂
I feel like they went backward. Im gonna miss some things
Which LG TV is at 6:20?
"Love your videos… BUT!!!

Just test them with NEAT noise removal in premiere Pro… or flicker free plugin… 

For the M1 Pro and i DONT agree that it rips, and just works 😂

It is not enogh.. maybe the max is.. but ill never know because you just tests one layer of video recording without effects 😂 noone is editing that Way.."
Reason for “no pro or iMac” may be materials. Just a theory
Sandals at work is an OSHA violation! 😂
0:29 can someone give a link to that background ?
I only come back to this video because of the intro. My God..!
Dose it flip over
Can someone tell me the intro track ? Couldn't find it on the 20syl channel. They have such great music.
Seemed like you were filming a mac commercial at the beginning
"THOSE ARE SLIPPERS, WE WANT SANDALS"
jesus christ. that intro is insane..
To bad they wait so long. Some of us want all that speed now and hope to retire before the next big thing comes out. Im one of them. I hope to get out of updating my products by 2025 then just live with what I have.
Sick intro
"Great, I’ll buy the 3nm in 2027"
this dude makes better promotion then apple itself xD
okayyy now i see the 1/4 million robot value now....crazzyy intro and i blame apple for always upgrading the bezzle notches but never face id
i got the macbook pro 13
Gave the like simply because of the ltt haha. Nah I kid. It was a good vid. :)
epic intro bro
Touch Bar<Notch
just buy the m1 and save money its the same laptop
Holy shit that intro!! Holy shit!
"Those are flip-flops, not sandals!"
4-6K for these laptops is a joke
"I see no point for the HDMI 2.1, what exactly are you going to be hooking this up to to make use of that? What media will you be playing it on to need it? It just doesn’t make sense"
This intro turned me on .... The production quality is insaaaane
M2 Max SmackBook Pro
That intro alone…
anybody know what wallpaper he's using? 5:04
Socks and sandals FTW.
😊🔥🔥
what? an ad? a new video is coming 😮
it's good for gaming you you dual boot and switch to windows but if you stay on mac gaming no its awfull lack of game dev. sup. they favorable windows
The slides don’t count lol gotta be sandals like some Tevas
"If everyone has a skin on, then having no skin on a Mac actually makes you only person different."
Will there be 15 inch MacBook Air?
These are flip flops not sandals :D
My brother just got the M2 MacBook Air in silver.
Is that A macpro behind?..
"Pro/Max is too heavy and expensive give us a 15"" MacBook Air with mini-led display. :)"
Wear socks 🧦 and sandles 👟 all day like Linus
i will wait for M10 or M20
You know those aren't the right kind of sandals.
A macbook pro is a 5-7 year labtop. Upgrading seems usles for 99% of us.
"I NEED YOUR HELP PLEASE, im about to buy thr macbook m2 and i dont know which configuration i should take. I use photoshop, some illstrator and browsing. Any recommendation please"
"I watched this video mainly because of the dopamine hit from the intro, soo satisfying."
Very nice video
Well i m a man of my word 9:08 😂 nice Marques 👏
shoutout to the one who created the intro of this video🫡
wow very nice video
Wi-Fi 7 just got announced not even a month ago
i want that wallapaper
I have an MacBook Air from 2013 still 😂
what's the hoodie you're wearing?
sweet opening video
I see Apple loves the 30% performance upgrade metric.....
"4k display, noise idle 4db, max ram 96gb, 38gpu, 12 cpu,"
"it's the same laptop as before, they just calling it the m2 so they could sell y'all all new laptops"
I never discovered limit with my m1 pro max
WAIT A MINUTE.He is using the trash Mac as a pot😂
Its kinda d.o.a. after they revelead that the 3nm chips will be out next year…
I juste wana m1 2020 🥺
Anybody know where I can get that wallpaper?🧐
dope socks and sandal ..... 😂😂
Slides don't count!!! Gotta come through
Nice view
I’m looking for a good Apple laptop for $500 or less something I can just edit my YouTube videos ! Nothing else honestly any recommendations?
I WANT FACE ID!!!
"those are not sandals, those are Adiletten"
It’s 2023 & MacBook’s still aren’t touch screen smh
Socks and slides look normal. 🗣️
Someone please tell me what wallpaper he’s using
Those aren't sandals! Those are slippers
Yep imma wait for the 2027 Mac M5s…
"Man’s wearing socks and sandals like it’s a BAD thing, 😅"
"I bet Craig Federighi saw the previous video and said ""Bet."""
Yeah all that power and no Face ID? What the heck?
the trashbin mac pro as a plant pot in the background is epic
Does anyone know what is a wallpaper on MacBook?
Can you ship the old m1 max to me 😅
What is the monitor at 6:25 ?
those are socks and slides bro. gotta do it again unfortunately
I DONT UNDERSTAND TECH THINGS MUCH BUT I THINK YOU DESERVE LIKE.
socks n sandals all the way 😂🤣
Socks and sandals 🤣
Where can I find that wallpaper 😍?
The best👌👌
Transistors smaller than 4nm behave differently so technically it is not possible. They need to find something else
"Those are flipflops, *not* sandals. 
One of them you can quickly slip into for convenience, the others are a *deliberate choice*"
Sick intro
As a macbook pro user for the past 10 years i will be switching to a windows 11 machine once my 2013 and 2015 macbook pro's die. Apple have lost the plot.
Damm what a intro
I’m not really into tech so I just need help scanning a ton of old photos using a brand new iPad Pro M2 that I just bought ?
A MacBook Pro should start with 16GB/512GB minimum. What's the point of calling it a 'PRO' if its base spec is similar to 'AIR'??
"if you don't have a7s3 and lots of crazy priced lens ,why buying 2000+usd mac? just for chrome book？lol"
Good conclusion.
"“Max”, “Macs”
This is probably an Apple marketing stunt but I can’t pronounce them differently"
Nice planter you have there
"those are flip flops, not sandals..?"
But does it run arma 3….
🥂🔥
Trash can in the back! 😂
"Ha, the old MacPro trash can is now a plant pot"
Where are Linus' sandals with socks???
unbelievable AI for nose and face.... soon enough we won't be able to tell.
6:27 who knows wallpaper link? thanx
true man of his word
"I am not a fan of the new models (non touch bar). they are heavy, chunky."
Socks and sandals ... Too good
👏🏿
"why are all the bench marks compared to old x86 chips - i9 9th gen, hello 13th gen out....!
Also a 7th gen and 11th gen pretty weird and skewed bench comparison? hmmm.
Also a very old threadripper"
Nice apple pro MacBook
Intel 12th Gen isn't in Geekbench list :/ 3:32
"I'm a bit confused right now, is this a review or a commercial?"
"All this but no touch screen. I am lost. They are the ones that introduce touch screen...so what gives? Surface Pros are great in that department, but I want to try Apple."
Bro turned into a netflix documentary
Why it's compared with much older Intel and AMD cpus? Hmm strange.
"At this point, I am just earning money to give it to Apple"
"I still don't get it why all 32gb models are so expensive. Give me the weaker cpu but please i need 32gb of ram it's critical, i really don't care much about cpu power, even 2019 intel i9 did all that was needed."
Which video editing app is that???
Where can I find that background?
I wear socks and sandals to not get my feet dirty
Mk make every intro madmax
No camera update
Next: m2 max pro max now has no ports!
"Everyone wears socks and slides tho. 
Or is that a no no for techys?"
"Man, these are flip flops, not sandals, it doesn't count!"
👏👏👏👏
Te best intro ever
I wish they would just add one usb port
Wearing socks and sandals to work is a privilege sir
"Is that a trash can mac pro planter, over by the window."
look at that notch 😂 🤡
"If you want to buy this laptop, go see another review."
🤣🤣🤣 socks and sandals lol
At least you didn’t promise to shave your eyebrows 😂😂😂
What is that wallpapeeer ???
Outer space is the limit with you 😅
"How is it possible that I can view 8K videos on YouTube with 4K rated gear?🤔 I have an entry level M2 Mini 512 (non-pro) and a Samsung 4K M7 monitor. Weird thing is I can see a difference between the same 8K video when I switch between the 4K and the 8k settings 🤔.  (took a picture in both settings and zoomed in)
I am using an 8K rated HDMI to HDMI cable with an ethernet connection so...?🤔 hmmm"
The inflated prices are not justified 🤨
happy with my i5 3rd gen cannot sell my car to buy a new laptop
M2 we see you
Where is the M2 Mac mini video???
But can it run Crysis?
How it still doesn't have USB-A ports?
Nice
Nice
People! Wait for the 1nm processors!!! Then we will see!!!! XD
bro called slides sandals🥲 great vid tho
Nice
My broke ass is still on the 2017 Macbook Pro. lmfao I am in need of a new one.
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I love how these YouTube videos have been reduced to discussions of the video production quality and not the Macbook?!? A bit annoying.
O V E R P R I C E D
i came here for that intro
"If i had 16M subs and 3B views, i would expect high production standards.

But then how do you explain PewdiePie??"
His joke at the end of the vid made me put a like
"I bet the battery 🔋 sucks 😞😔 & in the long run you can't can't change it like we were able to on some of the Intel Gens....  a lot of folks can continue to use their Mac book pro investments for 8+ years because they could just swap out those..  what now then? 🤗

More money than sense even if I were Elon"
"Nah, those are NOT sandals. 😂 C’mon bro, sliders don’t count."
35 % GPU increase? You cant even play the latest  games on it. Its like buying a Ferrari without tires.
"None of the synthetic benchmark scores were chart topping! all other processors and GPUs in the charts were from 2021 and older and are soo low spec. I didn't see any  11th/12th/13th gen core i7 / core i9 H/HX/HK/KS series processors. Apple silicon is not the best in terms of performance. Marques please compare to Newer, far more powerful CPUs, because even the new Razer Blade 16 can hit scores of over 32000 in multicore scores, and over 20000 in single core scores, in Cinebench R23. Stop showing viewers who don't know what YOU want them to see and show them what is actually going on!"
Wow
"Sorry Marques, but those are not sandals. You'll have to redo it with the correct footwear. :D"
Nobody talking about mac flower vase
"I want to buy the new 14"" macbook pro with m2 max, but it costs 4099€ with all taxes here in Greece.
I gues i am coming to US this year.
I will give the same and i get a free trip"
"can  i  run   unreal 5  on it ?"" for  game dev?"
"Ayo, what's that desktop background?"
Dat intro...
9:09 these ain't sandals
"My wife’s M1 Mac is such a miserable experience. Jitters, non responses, USB mics unreliable, needs reboots. Im trying to convince her to use an XPS15."
"Apple is being stupid. If they want they can get 100% Laptop market share right now. All they have to do is launch a MacBook M2 chip with Windows. That's it. They will take 100% market share. They should do while they are still ahead.
The minute intel decides to re-engineer their chips things will get challenging."
what is with apple and notches
Back and ready to over heat like ALL OF THEM. Not one has been good.
Apple MacBooks are the gold standard.
Apple seems to be wasting money releasing new versions of the same products they just released last year.
they should bring back the light
"I bought 16 inches MacBook Pro max m1 . didn't control exactly everything when I come home I see there is no usb. it's destroy the entire my photography life 
backup no backup I have to use HDMI  , mouse no mouse I have to use usbc . all my camera equipment is usb mouse backup sd card 
still confuse why . so I'm living in Iceland it's not easy to change everything . an small connection I have to pays more than 100$
an small connection wire is more than 50$ make me very upset but there is no choice"
"Marques, those are actually slippers, not sandals :)"
I feel like there’s a mic sound in the background all throughout the video
That doesn't count. Those aren't real sandals lol
So it’s faster and you pay more. The future is now.
epic
0:21 What is that jig on the right side…😮?
New ASUS Wi-Fi 7 router so they’re just dragging their 4 eyed feet to make $ off people they think are stupid
Geek bench 5
Bro you know you wear Nike soaks and slides everyday regardless lol
I don't understand why your cinebench charts feature old processors.. whats the deal? There are newer intel and amd processors for laptops that are faster..I mean the i9 for mobile shreds M2 Max.. so why don't you show benchmarks with modern competitors.
Socks and sandals truly awful but nice work keeping it real
"I just ordered M2 max 16 inch with 64GB of ram and 1 TB of SSD. Yeah it costs me a fortune, but  guess what? to me (and to everyone else I believe), we only have TWO options:

1) get a 1500$ laptop with okey-ish performance for everyday job, forget about heavy duty like 4k editing or decent gaming or even chrome with 30+ tabs, and then complain why it becomes so damn slow after one or two years, then head to Apple Store or other brands to get another 1500$ laptop for next few years.
2) Or, get this damn awesome beauty monster!!!! for 4000$ and enjoy the freaking top notch performance and not having a freaking single complain about it for 5+ years!! then replace it with a much much better alternative after 6 or 7 years and appreciate it for making your life so easy and good for last 7 years, and even keep it as an antic retro machine for other use!!!

Which one should you choose? Hell yeah m2max of course!"
its just a laptop if without touchbar
Rly good
"""chart topping score""
Has not tested any other laptop CPU's aside from old mac books lmao"
"Aren’t those socks and slides, not socks and sandals? 🤔"
9:10 BRO GOT JOKEZ🤣🤣🤣😈
"Didnt see you M on the list of creators
..."
"Apple is setting standards and crappy windows laptop makers follow unfortunately mostly with pricing strategies. I went to Lenovo website trying to customise similar specs laptop and guess what? Price is very same as per Apple and you get bloated Windows OS with it , slowing all down. Im sure Acer or Dell be the same. Windows laptops were always about better value but it seems it's no longer the case. If i'm to drop €4000 on laptop i'd just go with Apple. There is literary zero advantage going with Windows laptops at all now... :("
Best part start at 8 mins
What is that on the grey beam behind u a arrow ?
I need your help.... I need something I just compatible with it with the M1 to edit my videos I don't feel like searching YouTube all over the place please help me bro..... Have bless day
My head just hearing BMWs everytime he mentioned the chip
That intro was siiiiiick
one like for the socks & sandals! 👍
Lets talk about the music on the intro
Slides don't count. Those are hip.
give me the old one please :{
samsungs new laptops will destroy m.2 max without even trying there new cpus are crazy
"I wish marques was smarter. Like I wish he really knew the tech behind the tech that he talks about. It just seems that he puts pretty videos out on youtube summarising the insights of others. What he is doing is valuable too, but I wish after more than a decade of being so immersed in tech, he would finally start to get it, start having some original insights. 

That's generally the problem with reviewers who don't create, they lose the ability to think originally.

Anyway, good video and wish you well."
when there are more comments about the intro of the video and the production it kind of makes the content less important. It shouldn't be like that. The actual content is what people should be focusing on
Does it play divx videos?
Were you at all aware that you are showing Cine Bench scores of CPUs of 2 generations back. Where are Ryzen 6000 cpus and Intel 12 and 13 series. I am sure they will wipe the floor with this M2 MAX or whatever Max lies Apples have and paid to their sponsors..
"Lol, the fact that most of these comments focus on your production quality shows how much a lotta people wont care about getting this laptop."
those are slides not sandals
"0:47 lmao, what? Reusing old clips from past events 😂"
"buying a mac book is like going out to buy a laptop
losing your wallet and not getting a laptop.
regardless of either outcome, you'll just be disappointed and will basically not have a laptop"
Nice entro
LMAO at the trash can Mac Pro turned into a planter.
HDMI 2.1?
mans on the introduction shud have a pay raise
That doesn’t count as a sandal lol
"I’m sorry ‘Linus’, but those dont count as sandals… 🙃"
Socks and sandals… socks and sandals…
0:55 hmmmm maybe the tech layoffs mattered.
I always wear socks and sandals
Maybe I’m an idiot but I don’t get why we can hardcore game on these?
20syl yo!
Well in case of design I conider this mac to be downgrade.
IS THAT A PLANT INSIDE THE OLD TRASHCAN MAC PRO?
Notch? Nope.
LOL socks and sandals
Your Intro was siiiiiick
still gets 1 fps on Tetris 99
Lol they way tech is rolling silly rabbit 3nm chips are already in process. It's all about saving battery and quite possibly the first to make electric cars companies that are going down the drain gain better efficiency!!
That Trash Can Mac Pro in the background though
U put no.01 above 11th gen intel however 12& 13 gen are out... Maybe u should know
socks and sandles boii. pull out dem Birkenstocks LOL
We gotta see the toes Marques
that opener made me cream my pants and i’m hoping there’s a BTS on the studio 😍
No socks with sandals!??!?! 😟
"Ya! I did not get none of all you said, meaning I am computer illiterate 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️"
"Lol, socks and sadals!"
Need that wallpaper please
Why is there even a notch
It bothers me that he changed his scroll direction
"God forbid , don't sneeze on it . Will cost ya"
"PLZ play games on it, would appreciate the outcome"
"Could be worse, socks with tongs."
"Comfortable though, right?🧦🩴"
"M2 Air doesn't have a fan, heat sing or any heat pipes. On higher loads it can easily go above 100C and the cpu will lower performance to maintain better thermals. Ridiculous"
I always wear socks and sandals in my office. Can’t understand this stupid american thing about walking in boots inside.😂
I love socks and sandals...
Apple MacBooks and M series = Typical Diminishing Marginal Utility (Google it if you need clarification) with every release.
"5000 comments and only 10 of them cover the actual topic...what the fuck.

I'm still quite happy with my m1 from 2020. And i'm sure, 99% of the people dont need much more, despite buying the best model."
SOCKS AND SANDALS GANG!! 😂
Nike flops in the end 🤔🤣🤣🤣🤣
looked like slippers not sandals
"Sheeeesh, look at that intro..."
"Nah nah nah nah, those are slides not sandals. You've got to wear the socks and sandals like Linus, and not cheap out."
The usual Apple scam with minimal upgrades and a hefty price tag. What you get of RAM and SSD when you pay £2000 is criminal.. but hey matching colour cables haha
I liked this video just for the socks and sandals
People should care more about the actual review of the item being discussed not the editing skills
"Nice plant yo got in the background, IKEA ?"
m2 very very
"Ssd is slow in m2 max 16"" ???"
Death of Intel if it wasn't for the CHIPS Act
Apple is just going to stick an M2 inside the iMac. Not much to get excited about.
one thing I don't like about macs is that apple is cheaping out memory and storage on base models.
Those aren't sandles bro nice try 😂
Socks and strap on sandals like Linus. No cop out mr marques
For the algorithm
What’s wrong with socks and sandals?
Where are the shorts and your blanket Linus?
My Hello’s🎉
The fact that 2.3 million people are interested in a Mac product review is the problem
"My name is Max and my channel is M² ...I would like a word with your lawyers for stealing my likeness, Apple 😤🤣"
"i feel scammed, those not the right sandals"
Nice socks :)
your sandals and socks LOL
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱that's respectable
"Yes but, what’s the point of buying these laptops if they’re just going to make better ones the next year or 2? 

I bet apple already has the technology that will blow this out the water, they just release small increments of it every year to profit off of consumers.

Waste of money and precious resources if you ask me."
Bro you have any MacBook Pro for sale
"Anyone else dislike the haptic trackpad? I think that feature has a slight time delay that, if I am correctly detecting, drives me nuts."
"Sir ,
 if don't need you older M1 MacBook Pro can you please give it to me I will take it 🙂"
Worse multicore performance from 18 cores than a 5 year old 16 core...?
NOT THOSE socks n sandals - white socks & velcro (3x) sandals
Homepod 2 at 2:14
lol mkbhd is now asking for subs cuz other techtubers will definitely beat him 😂
Why is there no 11980hk 12980hk on the cinebench scores? Why? I see 9980h
Chart topping? All I see is AMD with more than 2x the performance. Why do we live in different worlds? Aren't we in the same reality?
my man. slides aren't sandals.
"6:00 It’s so damned disgusting that in order to get the newest available Wifi & Bluetooth specs on MacOS, you basically have to buy a brand new computer.  Also disgusting that there’s no way to get built-in 5G radio connectivity on Macs.  I know what you’re thinking, you can just get a usb modular based radio right?  Nope!  You can’t.  There are no drivers for MacOS.  Same with Wifi 6E!"
💙💙💙
Those ain't sandals
When Face ID ? Or pills ?
Socks and sandals it is....
Whats that wallpaper
Impressive... but It aint Windows. So its not for me.
"Cmon Marques, that's not quite Linus"
Have you left the studio?
"Sir, those are slippers(or slides) not sandals. You have not fulfilled your word."
That 5.000$ Macbook loses to a 2.800$ Laptop with RTX 4070 by 25% less performace.
sandal as in birkenstock my man not slides....
"Honestly, the notch bothers me so much, I'd pay 200 dollars extra just to have the webcam removed."
Socks.
Why is everyone talking about the production quality of the video.  Very strange. These comments seem “bought”.
RIP Tweetbot @ 5:00
"I am reading the comments looking for opinions on the product and I only see comments about the video quality. I LL short aapl, nobody cares it seems."
"As usual, everything by Apple is way overpriced and the consumer buys their stuff non the less. Apple, start paying the manufacturers in Asia a fair wage instead a miserable 168,- US Dollars a month."
Ditch the clicking sound effects.
shit i just got the m1 ..... full retail.... fuck ..... fuck .... should´ve do research here in mexico they haven´t come out
They're flip flops not sandles.
"and at the end of the day, Apple has made another expensive n overpriced professional toy for digital production to compete with doubled or tripled performance by buying 2-3 high performance laptops for the probably same price. Mac Studio is now in trouble vs Mac mini M2"
Those are not like Linus sandals
How about an intro in LEGO blocks style.
"”This thing rips” - your wallet, that what it rips. Apple is not in computers business, but in reselling RAM with 500% profit business. Not sure why they need so much money for RAM otherwise. Plenty of excellent laptops with expandable RAM available, so, whatever."
Can you please help me get one?  I really need me a laptop 😢
Good
I would never buy another apple computer again.  They stop pushing updates on them on purpose so you can't download any applications or programs on the Apple store saying you need this ios or later.  They do that to render your computer useless so you forced to buy newer one.
shoutout trash can mac pro in the back being used as a succulent vase
I’m sorry that intro was more Apple than Apple
those are not sandals 
Guys what was the music though. So earcumming.
Those are not sandals
Is it just me who thinks these reviewer are so out of touch with there audience. How many of us who came to see this review will max out the options. Just buy and review a modest version that your 60-80% of your audience will accentual end up buying.
I want Apple MacBook Pro M2 Max 😢 I never Used MacBook I'm a Student I need that 😭
"@marquesbrownlee 
Marques Brownlee please please we need wall[paper  which u r are using in this vedio"
I will not buy any MacBook Pro next decade.
Bro you gotta compare it to modern cpu's not these old ass ones. What are you doing
"Go to 2:44min ... 96GB Of share memory is a joke  or 38 Core Gpu .this is what happened when somebody give you something for f ree , ,,,"
It doesn’t count with black socks
those are socks and slippers
The socks and sandles
"Revolution, evolution, evolution, evolution, evolution, evolution, evolution,  evolution, evolution, evolution, evolution, evolution, evolution, - Revolution -- repeat."
"These are not sandals, no cheating man"
those are slides bro not sandals
"A MacBook is only judged by its top spec variation so 4TB, MAXED ram and top end SOC choice….

So all that on the M2 Max….

THAT SHOULD NOT COST 5600….. that’s fucking criminal, the computers SOC performance is TRASH and is NOT WORTH HALF THAT  - W7600 STUDIOBOOK Pro 16 from ASUS absolute KILLS Apple in this direct comparison, and that’s last years version from ASUS also which is radically better looking than the shitty new chassis the studio books are coming with now. 

A MacBook Pro won’t be as powerful as that laptop even for like 10+ years to come still"
"but those are ""cool"" sandals... you have to rock the sandals linus wears... those hideous... things... the name of which escapes me..."
is there aaaanyone in the whole world who likes the notch on the apple devices?
😄
Those are not sandals.
those are slides not sandals
"I knew it wouldnt be long before we got some new bullshit laptop. Now we have pro max for phones, and laptops"
I watched the into 23 seconds 30 times
lol...naaaahhh brah. slides and socks don't count. that's part of the cool kids uniform. you gotta grab some birkin stocks or something. lol. you need to look like that one cool uncle w/ the 90's bluetooth ear piece and the kangol hat.
How come you  aren't talking about the macs that are blowing themselves up and apple are claiming water damage? what kind of review is this
balls ⚽️
Why is this being compared against old ass cpus?
apple?! put the damn faceID in that damn notch! if I pay 3000 bucks for a laptop I expect that this huge ugly notch houses more than a 1080p webcam! I have an iPhone and iPad with faceID which is great but it‘s freaking annoying when I switch to the laptop and have to put my finger on that touchID thingy… which btw only works like 50% of the time…
Just that notch. Why. Just why. Where’s Steve??
"Apple Laptops are result of ""Excess consumption"" mentality. I bet almost 80% people who owns a Mac doesn't need one. They can get by with Pentium Gold without doing much. I truly appreciate engineering behind Apple Silicon but it's just useless for most of the people. I mean I am an engineer and I use i5-11th gen laptop with on-board Intel graphics without any issue. I have 40-50 Chrome tabs open, 2-3 IDEs including Visual Studio and My other design software open and yet Laptop doesn't drop a sweat. So, probably majority people don't need an Apple laptop but they would buy one out of herd mentality. Again, I truly appreciate engineering but I am commenting on spending pattern of people."
Those are slippers not sandals. How will I be able to trust anything you say in the future?
Doesn’t aren’t sandals
Sponsored by apple
Those weren't sandals cmoooon
What's that blinking below the video? It is irritating 😩
Those arent sandals bro
Apple''s new junk ) But video production is nice )
"yo, these are not sandals btw"
"Top Notch Design

Soo 2027 then ..
Give away time?
World's most profitable tech company and the only color they offer is that disgusting space gray lol.
"Oh Marques Marques Marques, those are not sanders my dear.  You need to take a lesson from Linus’ book. Actually don’t you have that floating sandal in your studio?"
This laptop is a cash grab and a shame on apple. Smh.
"Nah nah nah nah nah, slides are not sandles..."
Hi Linux!
2027 😂😂
Can I play fortnite on it?
Apple shill? Literally dogmeat for the price.
"M2 IS OLD from yesterday, where is M3 , FASTER BETTER !!"
"Sponsored content ? Why these performance bars are compared to so old CPU? Two weeks ago I bouth i7-12700h and it's waaaaay more powerful than M2 Max.
I respect Marques a lot but this video sounds a little bit strange.
That's why i like MrKeybrd as he never sugarcoats anything. Even guys from ""Nothing"" knows him as - this guy who destroys everything. Yes, because this is honest test and oppinion - how promises from brand compares to reality.
Marques - I'm waiting for honest test about M2 Max - try other laptops before and say what is not working - all sugarcoating leave to Apple and their marketing experts."
Eie that's winning
"i hate the reflective screen on there machines, no matter the resolution when screen is like a mirror. this is very big minus. it bothers my eyes"
Hmm stop bragging we get it! Its map for chicago😅😅😅
"Love the performance
Hate Apple."
Man look at that glare on the screen. No thanks. Aftermarket anti-glare would ablsolutely ruin the look. Ill stick to my Dell and my custom built PC
Who the hell needs an M2 in an iMac???

"All Macs sucks for Blender, Maya, Autodesk Arnold."
how many other people wanna sale they ass to apple
"I was a fun of apple products, but to me now they are just rubbish, will never buy an apple product they break even if we look after them."
Not impressed. Every technology gets better that is not only expected but required. Shouldn’t even have to mention that. My 4 year old laptop has 6E. Apple nickel dimes their customers. And it’s getting worse.
Love ur channel but it's plain to see how much of a salesman for apple you are. Bias getting in the way of fairness.
"Yeah that notch has got to go….. why the F**% is still there is pretty sad, it’s so ugly"
"all comments below pretty much all videos of this channel feel like bot farm comments. every fucking video everyone just posts ""huh huh such a cool intro"". the intros have been awesome for years, how are people still freaking out about them? I don't buy it."
"Why the stupid names. Pro, Max, Turbo, Hyper... and so on. Is Pro better than Max and if not how does the work. Does the pro not want the max performance. Nothing against Apple but their names are just so childish."
Where da sandals at those are slides
POV: you came here from the bts tiktok
6 and a half grand!!!! Get fucked Apple!!!
Stop buying apple...
"As a fan and user of Apple products, do you find it infuriating how greedy they are? Making their computers so most users can't upgrade hardware is BS. No, I don't want to buy a new MacBook pro with only a 512GB hard drive. Oh, you stupid, needy consumer... you want more storage... very easy for us to make special for you...SIGN OVER YOUR SOUL!!!"
please I beg give me one laptop whatever yeah is
woa
thess are not sandels
Ryzen 7000 series is better 🥱
Thank

This video lacks any critical thinking. Just a candy style Apple fanboy.
do people really care about macs anymore? apple is falling off hard
What a fucking intro
Nah... Apple still using their stupid chargers....
Stop reading the paper!!! That is so cheap for you...

Im glad this guy doesn’t talk like a black rapper gangster like the 90’s.
"Romans 3:23 states: ""For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: ""Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."". Romans 10:13 states ""For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."". 

   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell."
"🧡💛💚💙💜💖💓💟💝🎁🧡💚💜💓💍💎🌎🔥   *God demonstrated His love to us by sending His Son Jesus Christ, who died and rose from the dead to Give us eternal life.* *He also promised to heal your body.* *If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead* *He'll give you eternal life*
